# **PHP Frameworks: Overview & Comparison**  

### **1. What is a PHP Framework?**  
A **PHP framework** is a collection of pre-written code that provides a structured way to build web applications. It helps developers:  
✅ Write cleaner and maintainable code.  
✅ Follow **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture.  
✅ Improve security and performance.  
✅ Reduce development time with built-in features.
