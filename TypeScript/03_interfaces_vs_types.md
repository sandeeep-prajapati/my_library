In TypeScript, both **interfaces** and **types** are used to define the structure of objects and other types. While they share similarities, they also have some key differences. Understanding these differences will help you decide when to use one over the other.

### **Differences between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript:**

1. **Declaration Merging (Interfaces only):**
   - **Interfaces** support **declaration merging**, which means you can declare an interface multiple times, and TypeScript will automatically merge the definitions.
     ```typescript
     interface Person {
       name: string;
     }

     interface Person {
       age: number;
     }

     const person: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
     // The Person interface is merged, so it now has both 'name' and 'age' properties.
     ```
   - **Types** do not support declaration merging. If you try to declare the same type more than once, TypeScript will raise an error.
     ```typescript
     type Person = {
       name: string;
     };

     type Person = {
       age: number;
     };
     // Error: Duplicate identifier 'Person'.
     ```

2. **Extending (Interfaces vs. Types):**
   - **Interfaces** can extend other **interfaces** or **types**, but they do so using the `extends` keyword. They can also be used to extend classes.
     ```typescript
     interface Animal {
       name: string;
     }

     interface Dog extends Animal {
       breed: string;
     }

     const dog: Dog = { name: "Buddy", breed: "Golden Retriever" };
     ```
   - **Types** can also **extend** other types, but they use the `&` (intersection) operator. Additionally, types can represent **unions**, which interfaces cannot.
     ```typescript
     type Animal = {
       name: string;
     };

     type Dog = Animal & {
       breed: string;
     };

     const dog: Dog = { name: "Buddy", breed: "Golden Retriever" };
     ```

3. **Use Cases:**
   - **Interfaces** are generally used for **object shapes** and can be extended or implemented by classes. They are better suited when defining the structure of objects, especially when working with object-oriented patterns or class-based designs.
     - Use interfaces when you need to **extend** other interfaces, **merge declarations**, or work with **class-based structures**.
   
   - **Types** are more flexible and can represent **any valid TypeScript construct**, including **objects**, **primitives**, **unions**, **tuples**, and **intersections**. Types can define any shape, including complex combinations of other types.
     - Use types when you need to define **unions**, **intersections**, or work with **non-object types** like **primitives** or **tuples**.

4. **Reusability and Composition:**
   - **Interfaces** are typically used to represent **consistent shapes** for objects and can be reused across multiple declarations, especially in object-oriented programming.
   - **Types** are more versatile and can represent complex **combinations** of other types (such as unions, intersections, or mapped types), making them useful in more complex type scenarios.

5. **Compatibility and Flexibility:**
   - **Types** tend to be more **flexible** than interfaces, as they can represent almost any type, including **primitives**, **arrays**, **tuples**, and **function signatures**.
     ```typescript
     type ID = string | number;  // Union type
     type Person = { name: string; age: number }; // Object type
     type Pet = [string, number]; // Tuple type
     ```

   - **Interfaces**, on the other hand, are more specialized for **structural typing** and are generally more focused on the shape of **objects**.
     ```typescript
     interface Person {
       name: string;
       age: number;
     }
     ```

6. **Literal Types:**
   - **Types** can define **literal types**, which are types that specify exact values for a variable. This is useful when you want a variable to only accept certain predefined values.
     ```typescript
     type Direction = "up" | "down" | "left" | "right";
     let move: Direction = "up"; // valid
     ```

   - **Interfaces** do not have direct support for literal types but can be used with specific values in properties.

### **When to Use `interface` vs. `type`**

1. **Use `interface` when:**
   - You are defining an **object shape** (especially for complex object-oriented systems).
   - You want to use **declaration merging** (e.g., extending an interface or adding properties across multiple declarations).
   - You want to create a **contract** for classes to implement (since interfaces can be implemented by classes).
   - You expect to **extend** or **inherit** other interfaces or classes.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   interface Animal {
     name: string;
   }

   interface Dog extends Animal {
     breed: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Use `type` when:**
   - You need to represent **unions**, **intersections**, or other **complex types**.
   - You need to define **literal types**, **tuples**, or **function signatures**.
   - You are dealing with types that are not restricted to just objects (e.g., strings, numbers, unions).
   - You need to combine multiple types into a single one using the `&` operator (intersection) or `|` operator (union).

   Example:
   ```typescript
   type Animal = {
     name: string;
   };

   type Dog = Animal & { breed: string };
   ```

### **Conclusion:**

- **Interfaces** are generally more suited for defining the **shapes of objects** and are better for code that needs to be extended or implemented by classes. They are ideal when building complex object-oriented systems and when you want to take advantage of **declaration merging**.
  
- **Types** are more versatile and can handle **primitive values**, **unions**, **intersections**, **literal types**, and **tuples**. They offer greater flexibility and are better for handling more complex, non-object data types.

In practice, interfaces are often preferred for defining object shapes and structures, while types are used for more complex type definitions that go beyond just objects.
