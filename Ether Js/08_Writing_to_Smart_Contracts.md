#### **Topic:** Sending transactions to update the state of a smart contract (e.g., calling `set` functions).

Sending transactions to update the state of a smart contract is a critical part of Ethereum development. This involves calling functions that modify the contract's state, such as `set` functions. Below is a detailed guide on how to send transactions to update the state of a smart contract using `ethers.js`.

---

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed.
- **ethers.js**: Install `ethers.js` using npm or yarn:
  ```bash
  npm install ethers
  ```
- **Smart Contract ABI**: Obtain the ABI of the smart contract you want to interact with.
- **Contract Address**: The deployed address of the smart contract on the Ethereum network.
- **Wallet**: You need a wallet with a private key and some ETH (for gas fees).

---

### **2. Setting Up the Provider and Wallet**

To send transactions, you need a provider (to connect to the Ethereum network) and a wallet (to sign transactions).

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

// Set up a provider (e.g., Infura)
const INFURA_PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID";
const provider = new ethers.providers.InfuraProvider("mainnet", INFURA_PROJECT_ID);

// Create a wallet from a private key and connect it to the provider
const privateKey = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"; // Replace with your private key
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

console.log("Sender Address:", wallet.address);
```

---

### **3. Connecting to the Smart Contract**

To connect to a smart contract, you need:
- The contract's **address**.
- The contract's **ABI**.

#### **Example: Connecting to a Storage Contract**
```javascript
// Storage Contract ABI (simplified)
const StorageContract_ABI = [
  "function set(uint256 value)",
  "function get() view returns (uint256)",
];

// Contract address (replace with your deployed contract address)
const contractAddress = "0xYourContractAddress";

// Create a contract instance connected to the wallet
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, StorageContract_ABI, wallet);
```

---

### **4. Sending a Transaction to Update the Contract State**

To update the state of a smart contract, you need to send a transaction by calling a function that modifies the state (e.g., a `set` function).

#### **Example: Calling a `set` Function**
```javascript
// Value to set in the contract
const value = 42;

// Send the transaction to call the `set` function
contract.set(value).then((transaction) => {
  console.log("Transaction Hash:", transaction.hash);

  // Wait for the transaction to be mined
  return transaction.wait();
}).then((receipt) => {
  console.log("Transaction was mined in block:", receipt.blockNumber);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error("Error sending transaction:", error);
});
```

---

### **5. Handling Gas Fees**

Gas fees are required to process transactions on the Ethereum network. `ethers.js` automatically estimates gas limits and gas prices, but you can customize them if needed.

#### **Custom Gas Limit and Gas Price**
```javascript
const value = 42;

// Define the transaction with custom gas settings
const tx = {
  gasLimit: 100000, // Custom gas limit
  gasPrice: ethers.utils.parseUnits("50", "gwei"), // Custom gas price
};

// Send the transaction with custom gas settings
contract.set(value, tx).then((transaction) => {
  console.log("Transaction Hash:", transaction.hash);
});
```

---

### **6. Sending Transactions on Testnets**

For testing, you can send transactions on Ethereum testnets like Goerli or Sepolia. Use a testnet provider and ensure your wallet has test ETH (available from faucets).

#### **Example: Sending a Transaction on Goerli Testnet**
```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

// Set up a Goerli testnet provider
const INFURA_PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID";
const provider = new ethers.providers.InfuraProvider("goerli", INFURA_PROJECT_ID);

// Create a wallet from a private key
const privateKey = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"; // Replace with your private key
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

// Connect to the contract
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, StorageContract_ABI, wallet);

// Send the transaction
const value = 42;
contract.set(value).then((transaction) => {
  console.log("Transaction Hash:", transaction.hash);
});
```

---

### **7. Error Handling**

Always handle errors when sending transactions. Common issues include insufficient balance, incorrect addresses, or network problems.

#### **Example: Error Handling**
```javascript
contract.set(value).then((transaction) => {
  console.log("Transaction Hash:", transaction.hash);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error("Error sending transaction:", error);
});
```

---

### **8. Best Practices**
- **Test on Testnets**: Always test your transaction logic on testnets before deploying on mainnet.
- **Secure Private Keys**: Never hardcode private keys in your code. Use environment variables or secure vaults.
- **Gas Optimization**: Use appropriate gas limits and gas prices to avoid overpaying or transaction failures.
- **Confirmations**: Wait for multiple confirmations (e.g., `transaction.wait(3)`) for high-value transactions.
