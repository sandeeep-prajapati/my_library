#### **Topic:** How to listen for and handle events emitted by smart contracts.

Smart contracts emit events to notify external applications about state changes or specific actions. Listening to these events is crucial for building reactive and real-time applications. `ethers.js` provides a simple and efficient way to listen for and handle events emitted by smart contracts. Below is a detailed guide on how to do this.

---

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed.
- **ethers.js**: Install `ethers.js` using npm or yarn:
  ```bash
  npm install ethers
  ```
- **Smart Contract ABI**: Obtain the ABI of the smart contract you want to interact with.
- **Contract Address**: The deployed address of the smart contract on the Ethereum network.

---

### **2. Setting Up the Provider**

To listen for events, you need a provider to connect to the Ethereum network.

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

// Set up a provider (e.g., Infura)
const INFURA_PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID";
const provider = new ethers.providers.InfuraProvider("mainnet", INFURA_PROJECT_ID);
```

---

### **3. Connecting to the Smart Contract**

To connect to a smart contract, you need:
- The contract's **address**.
- The contract's **ABI**.

#### **Example: Connecting to a Storage Contract**
```javascript
// Storage Contract ABI (simplified)
const StorageContract_ABI = [
  "event ValueChanged(address indexed user, uint256 value)",
  "function set(uint256 value)",
  "function get() view returns (uint256)",
];

// Contract address (replace with your deployed contract address)
const contractAddress = "0xYourContractAddress";

// Create a contract instance
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, StorageContract_ABI, provider);
```

---

### **4. Listening for Events**

You can listen for events using the `on` method provided by `ethers.js`.

#### **Example: Listening for the `ValueChanged` Event**
```javascript
// Listen for the ValueChanged event
contract.on("ValueChanged", (user, value, event) => {
  console.log("ValueChanged Event:");
  console.log("User:", user);
  console.log("Value:", value.toString());
  console.log("Event:", event);
});
```

---

### **5. Handling Event Data**

Event data includes the parameters defined in the event and additional metadata like the transaction hash and block number.

#### **Example: Handling Event Data**
```javascript
contract.on("ValueChanged", (user, value, event) => {
  console.log("ValueChanged Event:");
  console.log("User:", user);
  console.log("Value:", value.toString());
  console.log("Transaction Hash:", event.transactionHash);
  console.log("Block Number:", event.blockNumber);
});
```

---

### **6. Filtering Events**

You can filter events based on specific criteria, such as the address of the user who triggered the event.

#### **Example: Filtering Events by User Address**
```javascript
const userAddress = "0xUserAddress"; // Replace with the user's address

// Create a filter for the ValueChanged event
const filter = contract.filters.ValueChanged(userAddress);

// Listen for filtered events
contract.on(filter, (user, value, event) => {
  console.log("Filtered ValueChanged Event:");
  console.log("User:", user);
  console.log("Value:", value.toString());
  console.log("Event:", event);
});
```

---

### **7. Querying Past Events**

You can query past events using the `queryFilter` method.

#### **Example: Querying Past Events**
```javascript
// Define the event filter
const filter = contract.filters.ValueChanged();

// Query past events
contract.queryFilter(filter, 0, 'latest').then((events) => {
  events.forEach((event) => {
    console.log("Past ValueChanged Event:");
    console.log("User:", event.args.user);
    console.log("Value:", event.args.value.toString());
    console.log("Transaction Hash:", event.transactionHash);
    console.log("Block Number:", event.blockNumber);
  });
});
```

---

### **8. Unsubscribing from Events**

To stop listening for events, use the `off` method.

#### **Example: Unsubscribing from Events**
```javascript
// Define the event handler
const eventHandler = (user, value, event) => {
  console.log("ValueChanged Event:", user, value.toString());
};

// Subscribe to the event
contract.on("ValueChanged", eventHandler);

// Unsubscribe from the event
contract.off("ValueChanged", eventHandler);
```

### **9. Best Practices**
- **Real-Time Updates**: Use WebSocket providers for real-time event listening.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully, especially for network issues.
- **Event Filtering**: Use filters to reduce the number of events you need to process.
- **Testing**: Test your event handling logic on testnets before deploying on mainnet.

### **10. Full Example**

Hereâ€™s a full example of listening for and handling events emitted by a smart contract:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

// Set up a provider (e.g., Infura)
const INFURA_PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID";
const provider = new ethers.providers.InfuraProvider("mainnet", INFURA_PROJECT_ID);

// Storage Contract ABI (simplified)
const StorageContract_ABI = [
  "event ValueChanged(address indexed user, uint256 value)",
  "function set(uint256 value)",
  "function get() view returns (uint256)",
];

// Contract address (replace with your deployed contract address)
const contractAddress = "0xYourContractAddress";

// Create a contract instance
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, StorageContract_ABI, provider);

// Listen for the ValueChanged event
contract.on("ValueChanged", (user, value, event) => {
  console.log("ValueChanged Event:");
  console.log("User:", user);
  console.log("Value:", value.toString());
  console.log("Transaction Hash:", event.transactionHash);
  console.log("Block Number:", event.blockNumber);
});

// Query past events
const filter = contract.filters.ValueChanged();
contract.queryFilter(filter, 0, 'latest').then((events) => {
  events.forEach((event) => {
    console.log("Past ValueChanged Event:");
    console.log("User:", event.args.user);
    console.log("Value:", event.args.value.toString());
    console.log("Transaction Hash:", event.transactionHash);
    console.log("Block Number:", event.blockNumber);
  });
});
```
