## üìò **What is LangChain?**

LangChain is an **open-source framework** designed to help developers build **powerful applications using Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It provides modular components to simplify the integration of LLMs with:

* External data (documents, APIs, databases)
* Reasoning capabilities (tools, agents)
* Memory (for context-aware conversations)

LangChain makes it easier to go from a simple prompt ‚Üí to a complex application.

## üéØ **Purpose of LangChain**

LangChain is not just a wrapper for LLMs like GPT-4 ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **toolkit to build intelligent agents and pipelines** that interact with data and make decisions.

### Key Goals:

* **Chain complex LLM calls**: Break workflows into logical steps.
* **Enable memory and context**: Keep conversation or task history.
* **Integrate tools and APIs**: Use external tools like search engines, calculators, and databases.
* **Handle documents**: Load, chunk, index, and query documents with LLMs.

## üèóÔ∏è **LangChain Architecture**

LangChain is built around the idea of **composable components**. Here are the core building blocks:

### 1. **LLMs**

Abstractions over models like OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc.

### 2. **Prompts**

Structured templates for generating dynamic prompts with variable injection.

### 3. **Chains**

Orchestrate calls to LLMs. Types include:

* `LLMChain`: Basic single-step call
* `SequentialChain`: Multiple chained steps
* `RetrievalQA`: Uses vector store retrieval + LLM

### 4. **Memory**

Add memory to chains for conversation continuity.

Examples:

* `ConversationBufferMemory`
* `SummaryMemory`
* `EntityMemory`

### 5. **Agents**

Use LLMs to **reason about which tools to use**. They act like autonomous decision-makers.

### 6. **Tools**

External functions the agent can use ‚Äî calculators, search APIs, etc.

### 7. **Document Loaders & Text Splitters**

* Loaders: Read PDFs, URLs, JSON, Notion, etc.
* Splitters: Divide text into manageable chunks

### 8. **Embeddings & Vector Stores**

* Generate semantic embeddings
* Store and retrieve using FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma, etc.
