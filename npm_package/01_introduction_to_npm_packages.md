#### üß† **What is an NPM Package?**

An **NPM package** is a **reusable module** of code (JavaScript or TypeScript) that can be shared and distributed via the **Node Package Manager (NPM)** registry. It usually includes:

* A `package.json` file that defines metadata (name, version, dependencies, etc.)
* One or more source code files (e.g., `.js`, `.ts`)
* Optional documentation (`README.md`), license info, build scripts, etc.

‚úÖ You can **install** NPM packages in your project using:

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add <package-name>
```

#### ‚ú® **Why Would You Create an NPM Package?**

Creating your own NPM package helps you:

1. **Encapsulate and Reuse Code**

   * Avoid repeating logic across multiple projects by packaging it once and reusing it everywhere.

2. **Share With the Community**

   * Contribute your solution to open-source developers who might face the same problem.

3. **Version Control Your Logic**

   * Use semantic versioning (`1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, etc.) to track improvements and fixes.

4. **Collaborate Across Teams**

   * Teams within an organization can use private NPM registries to share internal tools and components.

5. **Professional Portfolio & Reputation**

   * Publishing NPM packages builds your developer reputation and showcases your expertise.

6. **Monetization**

   * With scoped packages or private registries, you can offer paid solutions or SDKs (e.g., Stripe, Sentry).
