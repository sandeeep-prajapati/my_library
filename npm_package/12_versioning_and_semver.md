### 🔢 What Is Semantic Versioning (SemVer), and How Should You Apply It to Your NPM Package Updates?

---

**Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** is a versioning convention that helps developers understand the **impact of a change** in your package — just by looking at the version number.

> 📌 Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

Example: `1.4.2`

## 📦 SemVer Breakdown

| Segment   | Meaning             | Triggers to Update                              |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **MAJOR** | Breaking changes 🚨 | You made **incompatible API changes**           |
| **MINOR** | New features ✨      | You added **backward-compatible functionality** |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes 🐛        | You fixed **backward-compatible bugs**          |

## 🔄 Example Changes and Version Updates

| Change Type                   | Before | After | Explanation                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| Add a new feature             | 1.2.0  | 1.3.0 | MINOR update (non-breaking)        |
| Fix a bug                     | 1.3.0  | 1.3.1 | PATCH update (non-breaking)        |
| Remove or rename a function   | 1.3.1  | 2.0.0 | MAJOR update (breaking change)     |
| Change default behavior       | 1.3.1  | 2.0.0 | MAJOR update                       |
| Refactor code, no API changes | 1.3.1  | 1.3.2 | PATCH (if nothing breaks)          |
| Add optional parameters       | 1.3.2  | 1.4.0 | MINOR update (backward-compatible) |

## 🚀 When Publishing Your Package

Use:

```bash
npm version patch   # bumps 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
npm version minor   # bumps 1.0.1 → 1.1.0
npm version major   # bumps 1.1.0 → 2.0.0
```

Then push and publish:

```bash
git push --follow-tags
npm publish
```

## 🧠 Why SemVer Matters

* ✅ Users know when it's safe to upgrade
* 🧪 CI/CD pipelines can auto-update minor/patch versions
* 🤝 Maintains trust in your versioning

---

## 🔐 Bonus: Version Ranges in `package.json`

In consumer projects, people might use:

```json
"@sandeep/my-utils": "^1.3.0"
```

This means:

| Symbol | Meaning                    | Matches               |
| ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `^`    | **Compatible minor/patch** | `1.x.x` (not `2.0.0`) |
| `~`    | **Compatible patch**       | `1.3.x` (not `1.4.0`) |

---

## 📝 Summary

| Type    | Meaning                               | Rule                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `1.0.0` | Initial stable release                | Start here when ready |
| `x.y.z` | `x` = major, `y` = minor, `z` = patch | Follow SemVer rules   |

---

> 🧠 **In short**: Semantic Versioning tells users **what changed**, and how much it will **affect** them — just by reading the version number. Follow `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` to keep your package predictable and trustworthy.
