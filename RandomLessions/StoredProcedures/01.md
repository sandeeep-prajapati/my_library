### **What is a Stored Procedure in MySQL?**
A **stored procedure** in MySQL is a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and executed as a single unit. They are used to encapsulate complex SQL logic, improve performance, and enhance security by reducing direct database interaction.

### **How Stored Procedures Work in MySQL**
1. You create a stored procedure with SQL logic.
2. The procedure is stored in the database.
3. You can call the procedure whenever needed, passing parameters if required.
4. The procedure executes predefined SQL statements and returns the result.

## **Creating and Executing Stored Procedures in MySQL**
### **Example 1: Creating a Stored Procedure**
Let's create a stored procedure that retrieves user orders from a `orders` table based on a given user ID.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserOrders(IN user_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = user_id;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```
- `IN user_id INT`: This is an input parameter.
- `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = user_id;`: The query retrieves orders for a specific user.

## **Executing Stored Procedures in Laravel**
Laravel provides multiple ways to execute stored procedures, including **raw queries** and **Eloquent**.

### **1️⃣ Using Raw Queries in Laravel**
You can use Laravel's `DB::select()` to execute the stored procedure.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

$orders = DB::select('CALL GetUserOrders(?)', [1]);

foreach ($orders as $order) {
    echo $order->id . ' - ' . $order->total_price;
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `CALL GetUserOrders(?)` calls the stored procedure.
- `[1]` passes the user ID as a parameter.
- `DB::select()` executes the procedure and returns the results as an array of objects.

### **2️⃣ Using Eloquent Model (Indirect Approach)**
Although Eloquent doesn’t directly support stored procedures, you can execute raw queries within an Eloquent model.

#### **Example: Creating a Model Method for Stored Procedure Execution**
```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

class Order extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'orders';

    public static function getUserOrders($userId)
    {
        return DB::select('CALL GetUserOrders(?)', [$userId]);
    }
}
```
#### **Usage in Controller:**
```php
$orders = Order::getUserOrders(1);

foreach ($orders as $order) {
    echo $order->id . ' - ' . $order->total_price;
}
```

## **Advantages of Using Stored Procedures in Laravel**
✅ **Performance Boost**: Precompiled SQL reduces execution time.  
✅ **Security**: Limits direct SQL manipulation and prevents SQL injection.  
✅ **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates complex logic within the database, making code cleaner.  

### **Downsides**
❌ **Hard to Debug**: Stored procedures are difficult to debug compared to Laravel queries.  
❌ **Less Flexible**: Hard to modify without updating the database.  
❌ **Not ORM-friendly**: Stored procedures bypass Eloquent’s relationships and scopes.

## **When to Use Stored Procedures in Laravel**
- When executing complex queries that involve multiple joins.
- When dealing with performance-intensive operations.
- When working with legacy databases that already use stored procedures.
