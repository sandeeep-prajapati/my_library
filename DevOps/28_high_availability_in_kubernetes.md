Designing **Kubernetes applications for high availability (HA)** ensures that your services remain operational even if parts of the system fail. This involves both **Kubernetes cluster architecture** and **application-level strategies**.

---

## üèóÔ∏è 1. **Multi-Node Clusters**

A multi-node cluster is foundational for high availability.

### üîπ Types of Nodes:

* **Control Plane Nodes** (Masters): Manage the cluster.
* **Worker Nodes**: Run your workloads (pods).

### üõ°Ô∏è HA Strategy:

* **Multiple master nodes** in different zones/regions (with etcd quorum) to prevent single points of failure.
* **Multiple worker nodes** to distribute workloads and allow rescheduling if a node fails.

### ‚úÖ Example Setup:

| Component            | HA Setup                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| etcd                 | 3 or 5 nodes across zones                      |
| API server           | Load-balanced across masters                   |
| Scheduler/Controller | Active-standby or HA config                    |
| Nodes                | ‚â•3 worker nodes (preferably spread across AZs) |

---

## üö¶ 2. **Pod Replication and Distribution**

Use **ReplicaSets** or **Deployments** to maintain multiple replicas of pods.

### ‚úÖ Best Practices:

* Use `replicas: 3` (or more) in Deployments.
* Use `PodAntiAffinity` rules to **spread pods across nodes/zones**:

```yaml
affinity:
  podAntiAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: my-app
      topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```

* Use **`topologySpreadConstraints`** in K8s 1.18+ for even spreading across zones/nodes.

---

## üîÅ 3. **Service Load Balancing & Failover**

### Kubernetes Service Types:

* **ClusterIP** (default) ‚Äì internal only.
* **NodePort / LoadBalancer** ‚Äì external access.
* **Ingress** ‚Äì HTTP load balancing and routing.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Strategy:

* Use an **external load balancer** (e.g., AWS ELB, NGINX, Traefik) to:

  * Balance traffic across healthy pods.
  * Route traffic to healthy nodes.

* Leverage **readiness probes** and **liveness probes** to:

  * Prevent traffic to unhealthy pods.
  * Restart failed containers automatically.

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

---

## üîÑ 4. **Failover Strategies**

Failover ensures service continues even if something breaks.

### üéØ Key Strategies:

| Layer             | Strategy                                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pod Level**     | Use `Deployments` or `StatefulSets` with multiple replicas  |
| **Node Level**    | Use **taints/tolerations** and **node selectors** wisely    |
| **Control Plane** | Run multiple API servers behind a load balancer             |
| **Storage**       | Use **HA volumes** (e.g., AWS EBS Multi-AZ, Ceph, Portworx) |
| **DNS**           | Use **CoreDNS** in HA mode with multiple pods               |

## üß† 5. **Disaster Recovery and Data Backup**

High availability includes planning for recovery:

* Backup **etcd** regularly (etcd is the brain of the cluster).
* Use **Velero** or **Kasten K10** for volume and namespace backups.
* Design apps to be **stateless** whenever possible.

---

## üì¶ Example: Highly Available Web App Architecture on Kubernetes

1. **3-node control plane**, spread across zones
2. **Auto-scaled Deployment** with 3‚Äì5 replicas
3. **NGINX Ingress controller** backed by a cloud load balancer
4. **Readiness/Liveness Probes** configured
5. **HA Persistent Volume** using CSI drivers
6. **PodAntiAffinity** + **topology spread constraints**
7. **Velero** for backup and restore

## üß© Bonus: Key Tools for HA

| Tool                             | Use Case                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Prometheus**                   | Monitor pod/node health               |
| **Karpenter/Cluster Autoscaler** | Scale nodes automatically             |
| **Velero**                       | Backup and disaster recovery          |
| **ExternalDNS**                  | Manage DNS records dynamically        |
| **Istio/Linkerd**                | Service mesh for failover and retries |
