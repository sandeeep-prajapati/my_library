Kubernetes handles **auto-scaling** to ensure applications perform efficiently under changing workloads. It supports multiple types of scaling:

* ✅ **Horizontal scaling** – Adjusting the number of pod replicas.
* ✅ **Vertical scaling** – Adjusting the CPU and memory resources of pods.
* ✅ **Cluster scaling** – Adjusting the number of nodes (handled by Cluster Autoscaler, not covered here).

## 🔁 **1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**

### 📌 What it does:

**HPA automatically increases or decreases the number of pod replicas** in a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or StatefulSet based on observed CPU/memory usage or custom metrics.

### 🧠 How it works:

* Monitors metrics via the **Metrics Server**.
* Uses a **target threshold** (e.g., 70% CPU).
* Adjusts the `replica` count to meet that target.

### ⚙️ Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: webapp-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: webapp
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

### 🟢 Pros:

* Great for web apps or stateless services.
* Can scale based on **custom metrics** (e.g., request count, queue size).

### 🔴 Cons:

* Doesn't work well for memory-bound or CPU-spiky workloads.
* Needs **metrics-server** to be installed in the cluster.

## 📏 **2. Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**

### 📌 What it does:

**VPA automatically adjusts CPU and memory requests/limits** of containers in pods based on historical usage.

### 🧠 How it works:

* Analyzes pod resource usage over time.
* Suggests or applies new CPU/memory values.
* Can work in 3 modes:

  * `Off`: Only recommends changes (safe for testing).
  * `Auto`: Automatically updates pod resources.
  * `Initial`: Applies resource requests only at pod creation.

### ⚙️ Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: webapp-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: webapp
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Auto"
```

### 🟢 Pros:

* Good for **batch jobs or memory/CPU-heavy apps**.
* Helps avoid under/over-provisioning.

### 🔴 Cons:

* Restarts pods when applying new resources.
* Can conflict with HPA if not coordinated.

## 🛠️ HPA vs VPA – Comparison

| Feature                    | **HPA**                      | **VPA**                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Scales by                  | Number of pods               | CPU/Memory per pod                  |
| Good for                   | Stateless, web-based apps    | Memory-heavy or long-running apps   |
| Pod restart required?      | No                           | Yes                                 |
| Works with custom metrics? | Yes                          | No                                  |
| Conflict with each other?  | Yes (if used simultaneously) | Yes (HPA on CPU conflicts with VPA) |

## 🧩 Best Practices

* ✅ Use **HPA** for scaling microservices, REST APIs, etc.
* ✅ Use **VPA** for optimizing resource requests in batch jobs or cron jobs.
* ⚠️ **Avoid using both HPA and VPA on CPU at the same time** — use VPA for memory and HPA for CPU if needed.
* 🔍 Monitor scaling behavior with tools like Prometheus, Grafana.
