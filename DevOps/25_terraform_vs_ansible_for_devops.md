Terraform and Ansible are both powerful tools for infrastructure automation, but they serve **different purposes** and follow **different paradigms**. Here's a detailed comparison with examples to highlight how they work:

## 🔁 **Core Differences Between Terraform and Ansible**

| Feature               | **Terraform**                                        | **Ansible**                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**           | Provisioning infrastructure (IaaS)                   | Configuration management, application setup        |
| **Language**          | Declarative (HCL - HashiCorp Configuration Language) | Mostly declarative, YAML (Playbooks)               |
| **State Management**  | Maintains state (terraform.tfstate)                  | Stateless (idempotent execution)                   |
| **Agent Requirement** | Agentless                                            | Agentless (uses SSH or WinRM)                      |
| **Best Use Cases**    | Cloud resource provisioning (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)  | Installing software, patching, configuring systems |
| **Execution Flow**    | Plan → Apply → Track                                 | Task-by-task sequential execution                  |

## 🚀 Terraform Example: Provision an EC2 Instance on AWS

```hcl
# main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "TerraformWeb"
  }
}
```

### 💡 What it does:

* Provisions an EC2 instance in AWS.
* Manages lifecycle via `terraform apply` / `terraform destroy`.

## 🛠️ Ansible Example: Install Nginx on a Remote Server

```yaml
# install-nginx.yml
- name: Install and start Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: true
```

### 💡 What it does:

* Connects to servers in the `webservers` inventory group.
* Installs and ensures Nginx is running.

---

## 🔄 **Use Together for Best Results**

Terraform + Ansible = Powerful Infrastructure + Configuration Management:

1. Use **Terraform** to:

   * Provision servers, load balancers, databases, networks, etc.

2. Use **Ansible** to:

   * Configure the provisioned servers (e.g., install software, apply updates).

### 📦 Combined Workflow:

```bash
# Step 1: Provision infrastructure
terraform apply

# Step 2: Configure servers
ansible-playbook -i inventory install-nginx.yml
```

## 📌 Summary

| Criteria                | **Terraform**                        | **Ansible**                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Infrastructure Creation | ✅ (e.g., VPCs, EC2s, RDS)            | ❌                                                   |
| Configuration           | ❌ (not intended)                     | ✅ (e.g., Nginx, Docker, users)                      |
| Cloud-native Support    | Strong (modular, reusable providers) | Limited (uses dynamic inventories or cloud modules) |
| Orchestration           | Not ideal (declarative only)         | ✅ Sequential task automation                        |
| Reusability             | High (Modules, variables)            | Moderate (Roles, Playbooks)                         |
