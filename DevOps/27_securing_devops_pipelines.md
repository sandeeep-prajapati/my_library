Implementing **security best practices in DevOps pipelines** is crucial for building secure, reliable, and compliant applications. This approach is often called **DevSecOps**, where **security is integrated into every stage** of the CI/CD pipeline.

Here's how you can implement key security practices focusing on:

1. ✅ **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**
2. ✅ **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**
3. ✅ **Container Security**

---

## 🔍 1. **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**

**SAST** analyzes source code, bytecode, or binaries for vulnerabilities **without running the code**.

### 🔧 Where it fits:

* Early in the pipeline (pre-build or during CI)
* As part of code reviews and merge checks

### 🔐 Best Practices:

* Integrate with IDEs or CI tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI.
* Enforce scanning on every PR/merge request.
* Treat all issues as **fail gates** (e.g., fail builds on high/critical issues).

### 🛠️ Common SAST Tools:

* [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
* [Checkmarx](https://www.checkmarx.com/)
* [Bandit (Python)](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)

### 🧪 Example (GitHub Action with Semgrep):

```yaml
- name: Run SAST using Semgrep
  uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
  with:
    config: 'p/default'
```

## 🌐 2. **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**

**DAST** tests running applications for vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection, and misconfigurations by **simulating real attacks**.

### 🔧 Where it fits:

* Post-deployment (test or staging environment)
* After integration testing phase in CI/CD

### 🔐 Best Practices:

* Run DAST scans on every build in staging.
* Validate all APIs and user inputs.
* Regularly scan externally exposed URLs.

### 🛠️ Common DAST Tools:

* [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
* [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/)
* [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2)

### 🧪 Example (ZAP CLI in CI):

```bash
docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t http://staging.example.com -r zap_report.html
```

## 📦 3. **Container Security**

**Container Security** focuses on ensuring that container images are safe, non-vulnerable, and properly configured.

### 🔧 Where it fits:

* Pre-deployment and during runtime
* Image build and registry phases

### 🔐 Best Practices:

* Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine)
* Run containers as non-root
* Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities
* Sign images and enforce trust policies
* Use read-only root filesystem and set resource limits

### 🛠️ Common Tools:

* [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/)
* [Anchore](https://anchore.com/)
* [Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair)
* [Docker Bench for Security](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security)
* [Kube-Bench (for Kubernetes)](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench)

### 🧪 Example (Trivy scan):

```bash
trivy image myapp:latest
```

## 🧩 Integrating All in a DevOps Pipeline

Here's a simplified CI/CD security workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/devsecops-pipeline.yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run SAST
        uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1

      - name: Run Container Scan
        run: |
          docker build -t myapp:latest .
          trivy image myapp:latest

      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: ./scripts/deploy.sh

      - name: Run DAST (ZAP)
        run: docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t http://staging-url -r zap.html
```

## 🛡️ Summary of DevSecOps Best Practices

| Area             | Key Actions                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 SAST          | Scan code for vulnerabilities early and often                        |
| 🌐 DAST          | Simulate real-world attacks on staging or QA environments            |
| 📦 Container Sec | Scan images, use signed containers, enforce least privilege          |
| 🔍 Secrets Mgmt  | Use Vault, Sealed Secrets, or GitHub OIDC instead of hardcoding      |
| 🛡️ RBAC & IAM   | Implement role-based access controls across tools and infrastructure |
| 📊 Monitoring    | Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK for security logging      |
