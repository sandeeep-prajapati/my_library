### ✅ 1. **Using `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `OFFSET`**

```sql
SELECT salary 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

> 🔍 This skips the highest and gets the second one directly.

---

### ✅ 2. **Using a Subquery with `MAX()`**

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary < (
    SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees
);
```

> 🔍 Gets the max salary *less than* the actual highest salary.

---

### ✅ 3. **Using `DENSE_RANK()` (MySQL 8+)**

```sql
SELECT salary 
FROM (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk 
    FROM employees
) ranked 
WHERE rnk = 2;
```

> 🔍 Works well if multiple employees have the same salary.
