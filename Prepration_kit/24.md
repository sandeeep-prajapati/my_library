### ✅ **Connecting to a MySQL Database Using `mysqli` in PHP and Handling Errors**

You can use the **`mysqli`** extension in PHP to connect to a MySQL database.

---

### 🔹 **1. Basic Connection Code**

```php
<?php
$host = "localhost";
$user = "root";
$password = "";
$database = "my_database";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($host, $user, $password, $database);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("❌ Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

echo "✅ Connected successfully";
?>
```

---

### 🔍 **Explanation:**

* `new mysqli(...)`: Opens a new connection.
* `$conn->connect_error`: Returns error message if the connection fails.
* `die()`: Stops the script if connection fails.

---

### 🔹 **2. Safer Version with Error Reporting**

```php
<?php
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "my_database");

if ($mysqli->connect_errno) {
    echo "❌ Failed to connect to MySQL: (" . $mysqli->connect_errno . ") " . $mysqli->connect_error;
    exit();
}
echo "✅ Connection OK!";
?>
```

---

### 🧠 Best Practice:

* Keep credentials in a separate `config.php` file.
* Always check for errors before running queries.
* Close the connection when done:

```php
$conn->close();
```
