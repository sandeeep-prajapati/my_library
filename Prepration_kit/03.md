### ✅ **What does `GROUP BY` do?**

The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns, so aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc. can be applied **per group**.

---

### 🔢 **Example: Using `COUNT()`**

**🔍 Task**: Count the number of employees in each department.

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

> ✅ Groups all employees by their department and counts them.

---

### 💰 **Example: Using `SUM()`**

**🔍 Task**: Get the total salary paid per department.

```sql
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

> ✅ Groups rows by `department_id` and sums up the salaries.

### 🧠 Tips:

* All columns in the `SELECT` list must be either:

  * In the `GROUP BY` clause, or
  * Used inside an aggregate function.
* You can also `ORDER BY` aggregated results:

  ```sql
  ORDER BY total_salary DESC;
  ```
