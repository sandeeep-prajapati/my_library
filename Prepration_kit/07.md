### âœ… **How to Retrieve Duplicate Rows Based on a Specific Column in MySQL**

To find **duplicate values** in a specific column, you use `GROUP BY` along with `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`.

### ðŸ”¹ **Example: Find duplicate emails in a `users` table**

```sql
SELECT email, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM users
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

> âœ… Shows each email that appears more than once, and how many times it appears.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **If you want full row details of the duplicates:**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM users 
WHERE email IN (
    SELECT email
    FROM users
    GROUP BY email
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
```

> âœ… Retrieves **all rows** where the email is duplicated.

### ðŸ§  Tip:

* You can replace `email` with any column (e.g., `phone`, `username`, etc.)
* Use `ORDER BY count DESC` in the subquery to see the most duplicated values.

Let me know if you also want to delete duplicates or keep just one!
