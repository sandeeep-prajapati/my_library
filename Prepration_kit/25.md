### âœ… **Associative Arrays in PHP & Looping with `foreach`**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **What is an Associative Array?**

An **associative array** in PHP uses **named keys** instead of numeric indexes.

```php
$user = [
    "name" => "Sandeep",
    "email" => "sandeep@example.com",
    "role" => "Developer"
];
```

> âœ… Keys like `"name"`, `"email"`, and `"role"` are strings, not numbers.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Looping Through Associative Arrays Using `foreach`**

#### ðŸ”¸ Loop Through **Key + Value**:

```php
foreach ($user as $key => $value) {
    echo "$key: $value <br>";
}
```

> âœ… Output:

```
name: Sandeep
email: sandeep@example.com
role: Developer
```

---

#### ðŸ”¸ Loop Through **Values Only**:

```php
foreach ($user as $value) {
    echo "$value <br>";
}
```

> âœ… Output:

```
Sandeep
sandeep@example.com
Developer
```

---

### ðŸ§  Tip:

You can nest associative arrays and loop through them too:

```php
$users = [
    "u1" => ["name" => "Sandeep", "role" => "Dev"],
    "u2" => ["name" => "Om", "role" => "Designer"]
];

foreach ($users as $id => $info) {
    echo "$id: " . $info["name"] . " - " . $info["role"] . "<br>";
}
```
