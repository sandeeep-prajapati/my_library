### ✅ **What is Event Delegation in JavaScript?**

**Event Delegation** is a technique where you **attach a single event listener to a parent element** instead of multiple listeners to individual child elements. It works by taking advantage of **event bubbling**.

---

### 🧠 **Why Use Event Delegation?**

* Improves **performance** (fewer listeners)
* Handles **dynamic elements** (added after DOM load)
* Keeps your code **clean and efficient**

---

### 🔹 **How It Works (Event Bubbling)**

When an event occurs on a child element, it **bubbles up** to its parent, grandparent, etc.

So you can:

1. Attach a listener to the parent
2. Catch events from children using `event.target`

---

### 🔍 **Example:**

```html
<ul id="menu">
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
document.getElementById('menu').addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  if (e.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log('You clicked:', e.target.textContent);
  }
});
```

> ✅ A single listener handles clicks on **any `<li>`**, even new ones added later!

---

### 🧠 Key Points:

* Use `e.target` to find the actual clicked element.
* Useful when dealing with many elements or **dynamic content**.
* Works with any bubbling events like `click`, `input`, `submit`.
