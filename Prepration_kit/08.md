### ✅ **Delete Rows Older Than 30 Days Based on `created_at`**

To delete records older than 30 days from the current date, use `NOW()` or `CURDATE()` with `INTERVAL`.

---

### 🔹 **Query:**

```sql
DELETE FROM your_table_name
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
```

### 🔍 Example:

```sql
DELETE FROM logs
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
```

> ✅ Deletes all rows from the `logs` table where `created_at` is **more than 30 days ago**.

---

### 🧠 Tips:

* Use `CURDATE()` instead of `NOW()` if `created_at` has only the **date** part (no time):

  ```sql
  WHERE created_at < CURDATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
  ```
* Always run a `SELECT` first to preview affected rows:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM logs WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
  ```
