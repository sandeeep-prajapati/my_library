### ✅ **Difference Between `include`, `require`, `include_once`, and `require_once` in PHP**

These functions are used to **import PHP files** into other PHP files — but they behave slightly differently.

---

### 🔹 1. `include`

* Includes the file **every time it’s called**
* **Warning** if file not found, script **continues execution**

```php
include 'header.php';
```

---

### 🔹 2. `require`

* Also includes the file every time
* **Fatal error** if file not found, script **stops execution**

```php
require 'config.php';
```

---

### 🔹 3. `include_once`

* Includes the file **only once**, even if called multiple times
* **Warning** on error, script continues

```php
include_once 'functions.php';
```

---

### 🔹 4. `require_once`

* Includes the file **only once**
* **Fatal error** on failure, script stops

```php
require_once 'db.php';
```

### 🧠 Summary Table:

| Keyword        | Error on Missing File | Includes Only Once | Execution Continues |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| `include`      | ⚠️ Warning            | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes               |
| `require`      | ❌ Fatal Error         | ❌ No               | ❌ No                |
| `include_once` | ⚠️ Warning            | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes               |
| `require_once` | ❌ Fatal Error         | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No                |

### ✅ Use Tips:

* Use `require_once` for **core config or DB files** to avoid multiple inclusions.
* Use `include` for **optional files** (like banners, ads, etc.).
