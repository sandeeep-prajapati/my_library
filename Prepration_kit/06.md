### ✅ **Difference Between `WHERE` and `HAVING` in MySQL**

| Feature               | `WHERE`                                                  | `HAVING`                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Used with**         | Individual rows (before grouping)                        | Groups (after aggregation)       |
| **When applied**      | Before `GROUP BY`                                        | After `GROUP BY`                 |
| **Aggregate support** | ❌ Cannot use aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()` | ✅ Used to filter aggregated data |
| **Performance**       | Faster as it's applied earlier                           | Slower if used unnecessarily     |

### 🔹 **Example Using `WHERE`**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 3;
```

> ✅ Filters **rows** where `department_id` is 3 **before grouping**.

---

### 🔹 **Example Using `HAVING`**

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

> ✅ Filters **groups** (departments) where employee count is **more than 5**.

### 🧠 Tip:

* Use `WHERE` to filter rows **before aggregation**
* Use `HAVING` to filter groups **after aggregation**

Let me know if you want combined examples using both!
