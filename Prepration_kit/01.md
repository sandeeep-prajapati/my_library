Here’s a clear and concise explanation of the difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` in MySQL:

---

### 🔁 **INNER JOIN**

* **Returns**: Only the **matching rows** from both tables.
* **Use case**: You want records where there's a match in both tables.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

> ✅ Result: Only employees who belong to a department.

---

### ⬅️ **LEFT JOIN** (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

* **Returns**: **All rows** from the **left table**, and matching rows from the right table. If no match, right table columns are `NULL`.
* **Use case**: You want **all employees**, even those without a department.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

> ✅ Result: Every employee, with or without a department.

---

### ➡️ **RIGHT JOIN** (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

* **Returns**: **All rows** from the **right table**, and matching rows from the left table. If no match, left table columns are `NULL`.
* **Use case**: You want **all departments**, even if no employee is assigned.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

> ✅ Result: Every department, even if it has no employees.
