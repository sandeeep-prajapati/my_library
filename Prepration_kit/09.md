### âœ… **Using Subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` Clauses in MySQL**

Subqueries (also called **nested queries**) allow you to use the result of one query inside another. Let's explore how to use them in each clause with examples:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Subquery in `SELECT` Clause**

**Use case**: Fetch each employee along with the **average salary** of all employees.

```sql
SELECT name, salary, 
       (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) AS avg_salary
FROM employees;
```

> âœ… This adds the same average salary as a new column for every row.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Subquery in `WHERE` Clause**

**Use case**: Get employees whose salary is **above the average** salary.

```sql
SELECT name, salary 
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

> âœ… The subquery filters rows based on a calculated value.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Subquery in `FROM` Clause**

**Use case**: First calculate average salary per department, then filter on that.

```sql
SELECT dept_avg.department_id, dept_avg.avg_salary
FROM (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) AS dept_avg
WHERE dept_avg.avg_salary > 50000;
```

> âœ… The subquery becomes a **derived table** that you can query like a normal table.

---

### ðŸ§  Tips:

* Use **aliases** when subqueries are used in `FROM`.
* Subqueries can return:

  * A **single value** (scalar)
  * A **list** (for `IN`)
  * A **table** (for `FROM` clause)
