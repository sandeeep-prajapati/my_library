Here's a simple Batch script to display "Hello, World!":

---

### **Batch Script Code**
1. Open a text editor, like Notepad.
2. Copy and paste the following code:

```bat
@echo off
echo Hello, World!
pause
```

3. Save the file as `hello.bat`:
   - In Notepad, click **File > Save As**.
   - Set the **Save as type** to "All Files."
   - Name the file `hello.bat`.
   - Ensure the file extension is `.bat`, not `.txt`.

---

### **Run the Script**
1. Navigate to the location where you saved `hello.bat`.
2. Double-click on the file.
3. A Command Prompt window will open and display:

```
Hello, World!
Press any key to continue . . .
```

---

### **Explanation**
- `@echo off`: Prevents commands from being displayed in the output.
- `echo Hello, World!`: Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- `pause`: Waits for user input before closing the Command Prompt, so you can see the output.
