### **Explanation**
- `@echo off`: Prevents the commands from being displayed in the output.
- `mkdir MyFolder`: Creates a directory named `MyFolder`.
- `cd MyFolder`: Changes the current directory to `MyFolder`.
- `type nul > notes.txt`: Creates an empty file named `notes.txt`.
- `echo`: Displays a message to the user.
- `pause`: Pauses the script, allowing the user to view the message before the window closes.

Try running the script and let me know if you encounter any issues!
