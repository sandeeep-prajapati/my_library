Here's a Batch script that creates a symbolic link (shortcut) to a file on the desktop using the `mklink` command:

---

### **Batch Script Code**
1. Open a text editor, such as Notepad.
2. Copy and paste the following code:

```bat
@echo off
:: Set the source file path (the file you want to create a shortcut to)
set source="C:\path\to\your\file.txt"

:: Set the target file path (the location where the shortcut will be created)
set target="%userprofile%\Desktop\file_shortcut.txt"

:: Create the symbolic link (shortcut)
mklink %target% %source%

:: Notify the user
echo Shortcut created on the desktop for %source%.

:: Pause to let the user see the result
pause
```

3. Save the file as `create_shortcut.bat`:
   - In Notepad, click **File > Save As**.
   - Set the **Save as type** to "All Files."
   - Name the file `create_shortcut.bat`.

### **Explanation**
- `set source="C:\path\to\your\file.txt"`: Replace this with the actual path of the file you want to create a shortcut for. For example, `set source="C:\Users\YourName\Documents\example.txt"`.
- `set target="%userprofile%\Desktop\file_shortcut.txt"`: This defines where the shortcut (symbolic link) will be created. `%userprofile%\Desktop` points to the user's desktop, and the shortcut will be named `file_shortcut.txt`.
- `mklink %target% %source%`: This creates a symbolic link at the `target` location, pointing to the `source` file.
- `echo`: Displays a message indicating the shortcut has been created.
- `pause`: Keeps the window open until the user presses a key.

### **Run the Script**
1. Navigate to the location where you saved `create_shortcut.bat`.
2. Double-click the file to run it.
3. The script will create a shortcut to the specified file on the desktop.

### **Important Note**
- **`mklink`** creates symbolic links, which are not the same as traditional Windows shortcuts. If you want a standard Windows shortcut (`.lnk`), you would need to use a different method (e.g., `WScript.Shell` in a VBScript).
