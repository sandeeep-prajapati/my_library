Hereâ€™s a Batch script that tries to access a non-existent file and uses error handling to display a custom error message:

---

### **Batch Script Code**
1. Open a text editor, such as Notepad.
2. Copy and paste the following code:

```bat
@echo off
:: Attempt to open a non-existent file
type non_existent_file.txt

:: Check if the previous command failed
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    echo Error: The file does not exist.
)

:: Pause to let the user see the result
pause
```

3. Save the file as `error_handling.bat`:
   - In Notepad, click **File > Save As**.
   - Set the **Save as type** to "All Files."
   - Name the file `error_handling.bat`.

---

### **Run the Script**
1. Navigate to the location where you saved `error_handling.bat`.
2. Double-click the file to run it.
3. The script will attempt to open `non_existent_file.txt` (which does not exist). Since the file doesn't exist, an error will occur, and the script will display the message:

   ```
   Error: The file does not exist.
   ```

---

### **Explanation**
- `type non_existent_file.txt`: Attempts to display the contents of `non_existent_file.txt`, which does not exist.
- `%errorlevel%`: A special variable that holds the exit code of the last executed command. If the command failed (in this case, due to the missing file), `%errorlevel%` will not be `0`.
- `if %errorlevel% neq 0`: Checks if the previous command failed. If the exit code is not zero, it executes the block that follows, which displays the custom error message.
- `pause`: Keeps the window open so you can read the error message before it closes.

This script provides basic error handling for a file operation. Let me know if you need further details!
