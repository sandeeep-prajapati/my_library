Awesome question again, Sandeep! 🎯 Using **Git tags in Bitbucket** is a great way to manage **version releases** of your Laravel project, especially when collaborating or deploying via CI/CD. Here's a clean breakdown:

---

## ✅ How Do You Use Git Tags in Bitbucket to Manage Version Releases of a Laravel Project?

---

### 🏷️ **1. What Are Git Tags?**

Tags are references to **specific commits**, typically used to **mark release points** (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3`) in your Git history.

---

### 🚀 **2. Tagging a Release Locally**

Create a version tag from the terminal:

```bash
# Create a lightweight tag
git tag v1.0.0

# OR create an annotated tag (recommended)
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
```

> 📝 Use semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

---

### ☁️ **3. Push the Tag to Bitbucket**

```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Push **all tags** at once:
```bash
git push --tags
```

You’ll see the tag appear in Bitbucket under:
> **Repository > Tags**

---

### 🔄 **4. Checking Out a Specific Version**

Want to revert or test an older release?

```bash
git checkout tags/v1.0.0
```

---

### 📜 **5. List All Tags**

```bash
git tag
```

---

### 🔧 **6. Delete a Tag (Optional)**

- Locally:
  ```bash
  git tag -d v1.0.0
  ```
- On remote:
  ```bash
  git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
  ```

---

### 🔗 **7. Use Tags for Deployments or Composer Packages**

If your Laravel project is a dependency, tagging is essential for:

```bash
composer require your-username/your-package:v1.0.0
```

---

### 🤖 **8. Bonus: Automate CI/CD Deployments on Tag Push**

In your Bitbucket Pipelines config:

```yaml
pipelines:
  tags:
    'v*':
      - step:
          name: "Deploy Laravel to Production"
          script:
            - echo "Deploying tag $BITBUCKET_TAG"
            - ./deploy.sh
```

> This deploys only when a version tag like `v2.0.1` is pushed.
