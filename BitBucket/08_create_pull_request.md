Awesome, Sandeep! 🌟 Creating a **pull request (PR)** in Bitbucket is a crucial step for **collaborative Laravel development** — especially when you're working with modular branches like `feature/authentication-module`.

Here's a step-by-step guide tailored for Laravel devs:

---

## 📥 **How to Create a Pull Request in Bitbucket & Request Code Reviews for Laravel Code**

---

### ✅ 1. **Push Your Feature Branch to Bitbucket**

Let’s say you’ve created and committed changes to `feature/payment-integration`:
```bash
git push origin feature/payment-integration
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Go to Your Bitbucket Repository**

1. Navigate to: `https://bitbucket.org/<your-team>/<your-repo>/`
2. Click on the **"Pull requests"** tab from the left sidebar.
3. Click **"Create pull request"**.

---

### ✅ 3. **Fill PR Details**

| Field               | What to Do |
|--------------------|------------|
| **Source branch**  | Select `feature/payment-integration` |
| **Destination**    | Choose `develop` (or `main` if deploying to production) |
| **Title**          | E.g., `Add Stripe Payment Integration` |
| **Description**    | Write what you've done, any known issues, testing instructions, etc. |

💡 _Tip: Use checklists in your PR message like:_
```markdown
### Summary
- Implemented Stripe gateway
- Added PaymentService

### Checklist
- [x] PaymentController created
- [x] Routes added
- [x] Tests passed

### Reviewers
@teammate1 @teammate2
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Add Reviewers**
In the “Reviewers” section:
- Select teammates (e.g., `@AmishaSingh`, `@OmPandey`)
- They’ll get notified via Bitbucket & email

---

### ✅ 5. **Set Pull Request Rules (Optional)**
- **Require approvals before merge** via Bitbucket settings
- Enable **merge checks**: no open tasks, CI passes, etc.

---

### ✅ 6. **Review and Merge**
Once approved:
- Click **Merge** and choose strategy (`Merge commit`, `Squash`, etc.)
- Delete the feature branch if no longer needed

---

### ✅ 7. **Command Line Shortcut (Optional)**

If you're using Bitbucket CLI tools:
```bash
bb pull-request create --source feature/payment-integration --dest develop --title "Add Stripe Integration" --reviewers amisha om
```

---

## 🔒 Best Practices

✅ Use descriptive commit messages  
✅ Always test Laravel modules locally (`php artisan serve`)  
✅ Run tests before PR:  
```bash
php artisan test
```

✅ Avoid pushing `.env` or `vendor/`  
✅ Add reviewers who worked on related modules
