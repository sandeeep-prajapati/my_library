Perfect workflow-focused question, Sandeep! ✅ Integrating **Trello** or **Jira** with **Bitbucket** is super helpful for **Laravel project tracking**, ensuring every push, branch, and PR aligns with a task or ticket. Let’s dive in:

---

## ✅ How Do You Integrate Trello or Jira with Bitbucket to Manage Laravel Tasks?

---

### 🧩 1. **Trello + Bitbucket Integration**

#### 🔧 Setup via Atlassian Power-Up

1. **Open Trello board** → Click **“Power-Ups”**
2. Search for **Bitbucket Cloud** Power-Up → Click **Add**
3. Authorize with your **Bitbucket account**
4. Choose the repository you want to connect to your Laravel project

#### 🔗 Use in Cards:

- You can **attach Bitbucket branches, commits, and PRs** directly to Trello cards
- You can also see deployment status if Pipelines are enabled

#### 🌱 Best Practice:

- Use **branch naming convention**:  
  `feature/TRELLO-123-auth-module`  
  (Where `TRELLO-123` is the Trello card ID)

---

### 🧠 2. **Jira + Bitbucket Integration (Best for Teams)**

#### 🧰 Jira Native Integration with Bitbucket Cloud:

> 🧩 No third-party tools needed — both are Atlassian products.

#### ✅ Setup Steps:

1. Go to **Jira > Project Settings > Integrations**
2. Click **Bitbucket** and follow prompts to connect your Bitbucket workspace
3. Authorize and link your Laravel repo

#### 🚀 Features You Get:

- See **commits, branches, PRs, builds** linked to a Jira issue
- In Jira, view Laravel deployment status from Bitbucket Pipelines
- Automate Jira ticket transitions (e.g., move to “In Review” when PR is created)

---

### 🧠 Branch Naming Best Practice (Jira style)

If you have a Jira issue `LAR-205` (Laravel project), then:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/LAR-205-authentication
```

Then, in your commit messages:

```
git commit -m "LAR-205: Implemented login controller and routes"
```

➡️ This auto-links your commit to the Jira issue.

---

### 🤖 Bonus: Use Jira Smart Commits

Write commits like:

```bash
git commit -m "LAR-205 #comment fixed validation bug #done"
```

And Jira will:
- Add a comment to the issue
- Transition it to “Done” if configured
