Great question, Sandeep! 👨‍💻 For a modular Laravel project, using **feature branches** allows you to build and test isolated components like **Authentication**, **Payment**, **Notifications**, etc., before merging into your main codebase.

Let’s walk through how to **create and manage feature branches** specifically for Laravel modules using Git (with Bitbucket).

---

## 🧩 **How to Create & Manage Feature Branches for Laravel Modules (Bitbucket)**

### ✅ 1. **Start with a Clean Base**
Make sure you're on the `develop` branch and up-to-date:
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Create a Feature Branch for the Laravel Module**
For **Authentication module**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/authentication-module
```

For **Payment integration** (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay):
```bash
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration
```

👉 Use consistent naming like: `feature/<module-name>`

### ✅ 3. **Develop the Module in Isolation**
Structure your Laravel modules smartly:

For Authentication:
```
app/
 └── Http/
      └── Controllers/Auth/
database/migrations/2024_XX_XX_create_users_table.php
routes/web.php
```

For Payment:
```
app/
 └── Services/Payment/
 └── Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php
```

Commit regularly:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added login and registration controller for auth module"
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Push to Bitbucket**
Push your module branch:
```bash
git push origin feature/authentication-module
```

Now you or your team can:
- Review via **Bitbucket Pull Request**
- Add inline comments
- Request changes if needed

---

### ✅ 5. **Finish and Merge the Feature**
Once tested and reviewed:
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge feature/authentication-module
```

Then push:
```bash
git push origin develop
```

(Optional) Delete the branch:
```bash
git branch -d feature/authentication-module
git push origin --delete feature/authentication-module
```

### 🔒 Pro Tips for Managing Laravel Modules

- ✅ **One feature = One branch**
- ✅ Keep commits small and descriptive
- ✅ Add a `README.md` inside each module folder for clarity
- ✅ Tag versions after merging (`git tag v1.1.0`)
- ✅ Use `.gitignore` to avoid leaking `.env`, `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, etc.

### ✅ Example Branches Structure

| Module             | Branch Name                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Authentication     | `feature/authentication-module`  |
| Payment Gateway    | `feature/payment-integration`    |
| User Profile       | `feature/user-profile-module`    |
| Notifications      | `feature/notification-system`    |
