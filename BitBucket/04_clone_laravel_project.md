Awesome, Sandeep! Here’s a clean and complete guide on how to **clone a Laravel repository from Bitbucket and configure it locally** — the Laravel dev way. 👨‍💻🚀

## 🔄 **How to Clone a Laravel Repository and Set It Up Locally**

### ✅ 1. **Clone the Repository from Bitbucket**
Make sure SSH is set up (or use HTTPS if preferred):

```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

Replace `username` and `repo-name` with your actual Bitbucket details.

---

### ✅ 2. **Install PHP Dependencies**
Run Composer to install Laravel dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

If you get permission issues, try:
```bash
sudo composer install
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Create `.env` File**
Laravel uses `.env` for environment config. You usually won’t commit it to the repo (for security reasons), so do:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and configure:
```env
APP_NAME="Laravel App"
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=            ← leave this blank for now
DB_DATABASE=your_db
DB_USERNAME=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_pass
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Generate App Key**
Laravel needs an encryption key. Run:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

This auto-fills `APP_KEY` in your `.env` file.

---

### ✅ 5. **Configure Your Database**
Make sure MySQL/PostgreSQL is running. Create the DB specified in `.env` (e.g., `your_db`) using:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_db;
```

Or via GUI tools like **phpMyAdmin** or **TablePlus**.

---

### ✅ 6. **Run Migrations and Seeders**
```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```
This sets up your database schema and seeds test data (if any).

---

### ✅ 7. **Serve the Laravel App**
```bash
php artisan serve
```

By default, it runs at:  
👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

---

### ✅ 8. **(Optional) Install Node Modules**
If your Laravel app uses Vue/React or Laravel Mix:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ Done!
Your Laravel project cloned from Bitbucket is now fully configured and running locally 🎉
