Here’s a step-by-step guide to **initialize a Laravel project and push it to a new Bitbucket repository**:

### 🚀 **Step-by-Step: Initialize Laravel & Push to Bitbucket**

#### ✅ 1. **Create a New Laravel Project (if not already created)**  
Make sure Composer is installed, then run:
```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel my-laravel-app
cd my-laravel-app
```

#### ✅ 2. **Initialize Git Locally**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

#### ✅ 3. **Create a New Repository on Bitbucket**
- Go to: [https://bitbucket.org/repo/create](https://bitbucket.org/repo/create)
- Fill in the repository name (e.g., `my-laravel-app`)
- Set **visibility** (Private/Public)
- Click **Create repository**

> ❗ Do NOT initialize the Bitbucket repo with a README or .gitignore if you already did it locally.

#### ✅ 4. **Connect Local Repo to Bitbucket**
Copy the repo URL (e.g., `git@bitbucket.org:yourusername/my-laravel-app.git`) and run:
```bash
git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:yourusername/my-laravel-app.git
```

#### ✅ 5. **Push Code to Bitbucket**
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 🔐 Optional: Set Up SSH for Bitbucket (If Not Done Yet)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
- Copy the key and add it to Bitbucket → **Personal Settings > SSH Keys**

---

### 🎉 Done!

Your Laravel project is now pushed to Bitbucket, and you can start working with your team using pull requests, pipelines, and issue tracking.
