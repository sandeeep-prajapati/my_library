Absolutely! Here's an extended Python script to scan a range of ports on a target host and list the open ones:

```python
import socket

def scan_ports(host, start_port, end_port):
    """
    Scan a range of ports on the given host.
    Prints all open ports.
    """
    open_ports = []

    print(f"Scanning ports {start_port}-{end_port} on {host}...")

    for port in range(start_port, end_port + 1):
        try:
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            s.settimeout(0.5)  # Short timeout for faster scanning
            result = s.connect_ex((host, port))
            if result == 0:
                print(f"[OPEN] Port {port}")
                open_ports.append(port)
            s.close()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("\nScan interrupted by user.")
            break
        except socket.gaierror:
            print("Hostname could not be resolved.")
            break
        except socket.error:
            print("Could not connect to server.")
            break

    if open_ports:
        print(f"\nOpen ports on {host}: {open_ports}")
    else:
        print(f"\nNo open ports found on {host} in the range {start_port}-{end_port}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_host = input("Enter target host (IP or domain): ")
    start_port = int(input("Enter start port: "))
    end_port = int(input("Enter end port: "))
    scan_ports(target_host, start_port, end_port)
```

### **Key Features:**

* Scans a range of ports (`start_port` to `end_port`).
* Prints open ports as it finds them.
* Uses a short timeout (`0.5s`) to make scanning faster.
* Handles common exceptions gracefully.

If you want, I can also make a **multithreaded version** that scans **thousands of ports almost instantly**, which is much faster than this single-threaded approach.
