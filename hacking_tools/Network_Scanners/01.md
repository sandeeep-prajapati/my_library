Sure! Hereâ€™s a simple Python script using the `socket` module to scan a single port:

```python
import socket

def scan_port(host, port):
    """
    Scan a single port on the given host.
    Prints whether the port is open or closed.
    """
    try:
        # Create a socket object
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.settimeout(2)  # Timeout of 2 seconds

        # Try to connect
        result = s.connect_ex((host, port))
        if result == 0:
            print(f"Port {port} on {host} is OPEN")
        else:
            print(f"Port {port} on {host} is CLOSED")
        
        s.close()
    except socket.gaierror:
        print("Hostname could not be resolved.")
    except socket.error:
        print("Could not connect to server.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_host = input("Enter target host (IP or domain): ")
    target_port = int(input("Enter port to scan: "))
    scan_port(target_host, target_port)
```

### **How it works:**

1. Creates a TCP socket.
2. Attempts to connect to the target host and port.
3. `connect_ex()` returns `0` if the port is open, otherwise a non-zero value.
4. Reports if the port is open or closed.

I can also make an **enhanced version** that scans a **range of ports** or even **common ports** quickly if you want. Do you want me to do that?
