Sure! Here's a Python script that **detects the service running on open ports** using basic **banner grabbing** with `socket`:

```python
import socket
import threading
from queue import Queue

# Thread-safe queue for ports
port_queue = Queue()
open_ports = {}
lock = threading.Lock()

# Common ports for reference (optional)
common_ports = {
    21: "FTP",
    22: "SSH",
    23: "Telnet",
    25: "SMTP",
    53: "DNS",
    80: "HTTP",
    110: "POP3",
    143: "IMAP",
    443: "HTTPS",
    3306: "MySQL",
    3389: "RDP",
}

def grab_banner(ip, port):
    try:
        s = socket.socket()
        s.settimeout(1)
        s.connect((ip, port))
        try:
            banner = s.recv(1024).decode().strip()
            return banner if banner else common_ports.get(port, "Unknown")
        except:
            return common_ports.get(port, "Unknown")
        finally:
            s.close()
    except:
        return None

def scan_port(ip):
    while not port_queue.empty():
        port = port_queue.get()
        try:
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            s.settimeout(0.5)
            result = s.connect_ex((ip, port))
            if result == 0:
                service = grab_banner(ip, port)
                with lock:
                    print(f"[OPEN] Port {port}: {service}")
                    open_ports[port] = service
            s.close()
        except:
            pass
        finally:
            port_queue.task_done()

def main():
    host = input("Enter target host (IP or domain): ")
    
    # Resolve domain to IP
    try:
        ip = socket.gethostbyname(host)
        print(f"Resolved {host} to {ip}\n")
    except socket.gaierror:
        print(f"Unable to resolve host: {host}")
        return

    start_port = int(input("Enter start port: "))
    end_port = int(input("Enter end port: "))
    num_threads = int(input("Enter number of threads: "))

    for port in range(start_port, end_port + 1):
        port_queue.put(port)

    print(f"Scanning ports {start_port}-{end_port} on {ip} using {num_threads} threads...\n")

    threads = []
    for _ in range(num_threads):
        t = threading.Thread(target=scan_port, args=(ip,))
        t.start()
        threads.append(t)

    port_queue.join()

    print("\nScan completed.")
    if open_ports:
        print("Open ports and detected services:")
        for port, service in sorted(open_ports.items()):
            print(f"{port}: {service}")
    else:
        print(f"No open ports found on {ip} in the range {start_port}-{end_port}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **How it works**

1. Resolves the domain to an IP.
2. Uses multithreading to scan ports faster.
3. Attempts a **banner grab** from open ports (`recv` from the socket).
4. Falls back to common port-service mapping if banner is unavailable.
5. Prints open ports along with detected services.

I can also make an **enhanced version** that:

* Automatically detects **HTTP headers, FTP banners, SSH versions**, etc.
* Handles timeouts and unknown services more gracefully.

Do you want me to create that enhanced scanner?
