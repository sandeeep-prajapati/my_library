# 40 Prompts to Master Creating Hacking Tools

Below are 40 prompts to help you master building tools for network scanners, web vulnerability scanners, exploit development, automation, and malware analysis/reverse engineering. Use Python with libraries like `socket`, `scapy`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `pwntools`, and `pefile`. Always test in a controlled lab environment (e.g., VirtualBox with DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop) with explicit permission.

## Network Scanners (Port Scanners, Packet Sniffers)
1. Write a Python script using `socket` to scan a single port on a target host and report if it’s open or closed.
2. Extend the script to scan a range of ports (e.g., 1–1000) on a target host and list open ports.
3. Add multithreading to your port scanner to speed up scanning multiple ports concurrently.
4. Create a port scanner that resolves a domain name to an IP address before scanning.
5. Write a script to detect the service (e.g., HTTP, SSH) running on open ports using `socket` and banner grabbing.
6. Use `scapy` to craft and send a TCP SYN packet to a target port and analyze the response to determine if it’s open.
7. Build a packet sniffer with `scapy` to capture and display HTTP traffic on a specific network interface.
8. Modify the sniffer to filter and extract URLs from HTTP GET requests.
9. Create a script to detect ARP spoofing attempts on a network using `scapy`.
10. Develop a tool that scans a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) to discover live hosts using ICMP ping.

## Web Vulnerability Scanners (SQL Injection, XSS)
11. Write a Python script using `requests` to send an HTTP GET request to a URL and check for a specific response code.
12. Create a script to crawl a website using `beautifulsoup4` and extract all hyperlinks.
13. Build a tool to test for open redirects by injecting a malicious URL into a `redirect` parameter and checking the response.
14. Write a script to test a login form for SQL injection by sending payloads like `' OR '1'='1` and checking for successful logins.
15. Develop a tool to detect reflected XSS by injecting `<script>alert('test')</script>` into URL parameters and parsing the response.
16. Create a script to identify outdated JavaScript libraries on a website by parsing HTML and checking version numbers.
17. Build a tool to test for CSRF vulnerabilities by submitting a form without a CSRF token and checking if it’s accepted.
18. Write a script to enumerate subdomains of a target website using a wordlist and `requests`.
19. Develop a tool to check for insecure HTTP headers (e.g., missing `X-Frame-Options`) using `requests`.
20. Create a web scanner that combines SQL injection, XSS, and open redirect tests into a single tool with a user-friendly report.

## Exploit Development (Buffer Overflows, Shellcode)
21. Write a Python script to fuzz a network service by sending increasingly large inputs to crash it.
22. Use `pwntools` to create a script that connects to a vulnerable TCP server and sends a buffer overflow payload.
23. Develop a tool to generate shellcode for a reverse TCP shell using `pwntools`.
24. Write a script to test a local program for buffer overflow by passing a long string as input and checking for crashes.
25. Create a Python script to automate finding the offset for a buffer overflow exploit using a cyclic pattern.
26. Build an exploit that overwrites a program’s EIP register with a specific address using `pwntools`.
27. Write a script to encode shellcode to bypass basic input filters (e.g., alphanumeric encoding).
28. Develop a tool to test for format string vulnerabilities by sending `%s` payloads and analyzing output.
29. Create a script to automate stack-based buffer overflow exploitation with a NOP sled and shellcode.
30. Build a tool to test for heap-based buffer overflows by allocating and freeing memory in a controlled way.

## Automation of Repetitive Tasks (Brute-Forcing, Credential Stuffing)
31. Write a Python script using `requests` to brute-force a login form with a username and password wordlist.
32. Add rate-limiting detection to your brute-forcer to pause when the server responds with HTTP 429.
33. Create a script to automate directory enumeration on a web server using a wordlist and `requests`.
34. Develop a tool to test SSH credentials on a target server using `paramiko` and a password list.
35. Write a script to automate credential stuffing across multiple websites using a leaked username:password list.
36. Build a tool to automate API key enumeration by testing common key patterns in API endpoints.
37. Create a script to automate WHOIS lookups for a list of domains and extract registrar information.
38. Develop a tool to automate testing for weak CORS configurations by sending cross-origin requests.

## Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering
39. Write a Python script using `pefile` to extract the import table from a Windows PE executable.
40. Create a tool to analyze a binary for suspicious strings (e.g., URLs, IP addresses) using `pefile` and regular expressions.

### Tips for Success
- **Environment**: Use a lab like VirtualBox with Kali Linux, DVWA, or OWASP Juice Shop.
- **Ethics**: Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
- **Resources**: Study OWASP Top 10, TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and CTF challenges.
- **Libraries**: Install Python libraries (`pip install requests beautifulsoup4 scapy pwntools pefile paramiko`).
- **Debugging**: Test incrementally and handle errors (e.g., network timeouts, HTTP errors).

Start with simpler prompts (e.g., 1–10) and progress to advanced ones (e.g., 21–40) as you gain confidence. Each prompt builds practical skills for creating ethical hacking tools responsibly.
