## 🚧 1. What Is `unsafe` Rust?

Rust is known for **memory safety guarantees without a garbage collector** — enforced by the **borrow checker** and **ownership system**.

However, sometimes you need to do **low-level operations** that the compiler **cannot verify as safe**, such as:

* Interacting with C code
* Accessing raw memory
* Implementing performance-critical abstractions

That’s where **`unsafe` Rust** comes in.

> 🔑 **`unsafe` Rust = opt-out of some compiler safety checks**, but **you’re responsible** for upholding safety manually.

---

## 🧩 2. What You Can Do in `unsafe` Rust

The `unsafe` keyword allows five kinds of actions that normal (“safe”) Rust forbids.

### 🧱 1. Dereference Raw Pointers

```rust
let mut num = 42;
let r1 = &num as *const i32;
let r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;

unsafe {
    println!("r1 is: {}", *r1);
    *r2 = 10;
}
```

> ⚠️ You must ensure the pointer is **valid** and **non-null** before dereferencing.

---

### 🔄 2. Call Unsafe Functions or Methods

```rust
unsafe fn dangerous() {
    println!("This is unsafe!");
}

unsafe {
    dangerous();
}
```

You must wrap the call in an `unsafe` block — this **isolates** unsafe behavior.

---

### 🧱 3. Access or Modify Mutable Static Variables

```rust
static mut COUNTER: i32 = 0;

unsafe {
    COUNTER += 1;
    println!("COUNTER = {}", COUNTER);
}
```

Global mutable variables can cause **data races**, so Rust requires `unsafe` for access.

---

### 🧬 4. Implement Unsafe Traits

```rust
unsafe trait UnsafeTrait {
    fn do_something();
}

unsafe impl UnsafeTrait for i32 {
    fn do_something() {
        println!("Unsafe trait implemented!");
    }
}
```

This is needed when a trait’s contract can’t be verified by the compiler.

---

### 🧠 5. Access Union Fields

```rust
union MyUnion {
    i: i32,
    f: f32,
}

let u = MyUnion { i: 5 };
unsafe {
    println!("union field = {}", u.i);
}
```

`union`s are inherently unsafe because Rust can’t track which field is valid.

---

## ⚙️ 3. Safe vs. Unsafe Blocks

A **safe function** can contain **`unsafe` blocks**, but not the other way around.

```rust
fn safe_function() {
    let ptr = 42 as *const i32;
    unsafe {
        println!("{}", *ptr);
    }
}
```

But marking a function itself as `unsafe` means **the caller must use an unsafe block**:

```rust
unsafe fn do_something() {}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        do_something();
    }
}
```

---

## 🧩 4. Why Does Rust Even Allow `unsafe`?

Because Rust aims to be:

* **Safe by default**
* **Low-level capable** (like C/C++)
* **Zero-cost abstraction friendly**

Many standard library features (like `Vec`, `Box`, `Arc`, and `Rc`) are internally implemented using `unsafe`, but **expose a safe interface**.

```rust
// Example from Vec<T> internals (simplified)
unsafe {
    let ptr = std::alloc::alloc(layout) as *mut T;
    // manually manage memory...
}
```

> So you can think of `unsafe` as a **tool for library authors**, not for everyday application code.

## 🚦 5. When to Use `unsafe` (and When NOT to)

### ✅ **Legitimate Use Cases**

| Case                             | Example                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| FFI (Foreign Function Interface) | Calling C APIs or integrating with OS                    |
| Manual memory management         | Writing allocators, custom smart pointers                |
| Performance-critical code        | Avoiding runtime checks in tight loops                   |
| Implementing abstractions        | Writing a `Vec<T>` or `Mutex<T>` type                    |
| Hardware interaction             | Reading/writing memory-mapped registers in embedded Rust |

---

### ❌ **Avoid Unsafe When**

* You can solve it with **lifetimes**, **borrowing**, or **safe abstractions**.
* You’re unsure about **aliasing**, **thread-safety**, or **pointer validity**.
* You’re doing **application-level logic** (like parsing JSON or file I/O).

## 🧠 6. Best Practices for `unsafe` Rust

| Practice                                | Explanation                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Minimize scope                       | Wrap only the necessary code in an `unsafe {}` block                                   |
| 📦 Hide unsafe behind safe abstractions | Expose a safe API to users                                                             |
| 🧾 Document invariants                  | Explain what must remain true for the code to be safe                                  |
| ✅ Use `unsafe` lints and tools          | Tools like [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) can catch UB (undefined behavior) |
| 🔍 Review carefully                     | Unsafe code must be audited — treat it like C-level code                               |

## 💡 7. Example: Creating a Safe Wrapper Around Unsafe Code

Let’s say you want to read an integer from a raw pointer:

```rust
unsafe fn read_from_ptr(ptr: *const i32) -> i32 {
    *ptr
}

fn safe_read(ptr: *const i32) -> Option<i32> {
    if ptr.is_null() {
        None
    } else {
        unsafe { Some(*ptr) }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = 42;
    let ptr = &x as *const i32;
    println!("{:?}", safe_read(ptr)); // Safe wrapper around unsafe code
}
```

✅ This keeps the **unsafe logic minimal and controlled**.

### 🧩 Quick Analogy

> Safe Rust = car with automatic safety systems (seatbelts, ABS)
> Unsafe Rust = turning them off to drive on a racetrack — you get more control, but also more risk.
