Okay Sandeep — you’re basically talking about a **SaaS AI chatbot** that:

1. **Integrates into any e-commerce site** (Shopify, WooCommerce, custom Laravel/Django stores).
2. **Chats with the customer** and helps them find products.
3. **Remembers & tracks their favorite products** from that shop.
4. **Lets you use that data later for marketing** (email/SMS campaigns, personalized offers).
5. **Runs free initially** to attract store owners, but you collect useful analytics for future upsells.

## **High-Level Flow**

1. **User visits store** → Chatbot widget appears.
2. **User chats**: “I’m looking for black sneakers under ₹2,000.”
3. **Chatbot searches products** (via vector database for semantic matching).
4. **User clicks ❤️ on products they like** (favorites).
5. **Favorites are stored per user session** (linked to email/phone if they share).
6. **Data stored in your central SaaS backend** for future retargeting.
