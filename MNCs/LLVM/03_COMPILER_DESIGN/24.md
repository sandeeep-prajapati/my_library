Absolutely, Sandeep! Letâ€™s dive into **syntax analysis**, also called **parsing**, which is a core phase of a compiler.

## âœ… What is Syntax Analysis (Parsing)?

**Syntax analysis** is the **second phase of a compiler**, coming after lexical analysis.

**Purpose:**

1. Take the **tokens** produced by the **lexical analyzer**.
2. Check whether they follow the **grammar rules** of the programming language.
3. Build a **parse tree** or **abstract syntax tree (AST)** that represents the program structure.

## ðŸ”¹ Input and Output

| Phase            | Input       | Output                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Lexical Analysis | Source code | Tokens                                  |
| Parsing          | Tokens      | Parse Tree / Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) |

## ðŸ”¹ Why Syntax Analysis is Important

* Ensures that the program is **syntactically correct**.
* Detects **syntax errors** early.
* Provides a **tree structure** for semantic analysis and code generation.
* Helps enforce **operator precedence and associativity**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example

**Source Code:**

```cpp
int x = 10 + 20;
```

**Tokens (from lexical analysis):**

```
KEYWORD(int), IDENTIFIER(x), OPERATOR(=), NUMBER(10), OPERATOR(+), NUMBER(20), SEMICOLON(;)
```

**Parse Tree:**

```
       <stmt>
       /    \
    <type>   <assign>
     |      /   |   \
    int   x    =   <expr>
                     / | \
                   10  +  20
```

* Shows how tokens **fit the grammar rules**.
* Parentheses, operator precedence, and statement structure are enforced.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools for Parsing

* **Top-down parsers:** Recursive Descent, LL(1)
* **Bottom-up parsers:** LR, LALR (used in Bison/Yacc)
* Parser generators: **Bison**, **Yacc**, **ANTLR**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Summary

* Lexical analysis â†’ produces **tokens**.
* **Parsing** â†’ checks grammar, produces **parse tree/AST**.
* Essential for **syntax error detection**, **operator precedence**, and preparing for **semantic analysis** and **code generation**.

If you want, I can **draw a diagram showing the full compiler workflow** from source code â†’ lexical analysis â†’ parsing â†’ semantic analysis â†’ code generation, which makes it super easy to visualize for projects like LLVM.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
