Absolutely, Sandeep! Let’s break down **static vs shared libraries** in C++ and how **CMake** handles them.

## ✅ 1️⃣ Static Libraries

**Definition:**

* A **static library** is a collection of object files **linked into the executable at compile time**.
* After linking, the executable **contains all the code** it needs.

**File Extensions:**

* Linux: `.a`
* Windows: `.lib`

### 🔹 Advantages

1. No dependency on external files at runtime.
2. Slightly faster execution (no dynamic linking).

### 🔹 Disadvantages

1. Executable size increases.
2. Updating the library requires **recompiling the executable**.

## 🔹 CMake Example: Static Library

### Folder Structure

```
StaticExample/
 ├── CMakeLists.txt
 ├── main.cpp
 └── mathlib/
      ├── CMakeLists.txt
      └── math.cpp
```

### `mathlib/CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
# Create a static library
add_library(mathlib STATIC math.cpp)
```

### `CMakeLists.txt` (Top-level)

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(StaticExample LANGUAGES CXX)

add_subdirectory(mathlib)

add_executable(MainExec main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(MainExec PRIVATE mathlib)
```

**Result:**

* `MainExec` contains all code from `mathlib`.
* No external dependency at runtime.

---

## ✅ 2️⃣ Shared Libraries

**Definition:**

* A **shared library** (dynamic library) is **linked at runtime**, not compile time.
* Executable contains **references** to the library; the OS loads it when needed.

**File Extensions:**

* Linux: `.so`
* Windows: `.dll`

### 🔹 Advantages

1. Smaller executable size.
2. Multiple programs can **share the same library in memory**.
3. Easy to update library without recompiling executables.

### 🔹 Disadvantages

1. Program fails if the shared library is missing.
2. Slight runtime overhead.

## 🔹 CMake Example: Shared Library

### `mathlib/CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
# Create a shared library
add_library(mathlib SHARED math.cpp)
```

### `CMakeLists.txt` (Top-level)

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(SharedExample LANGUAGES CXX)

add_subdirectory(mathlib)

add_executable(MainExec main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(MainExec PRIVATE mathlib)
```

**Result:**

* `MainExec` is smaller.
* Requires `libmathlib.so` (Linux) or `mathlib.dll` (Windows) at runtime.

## 🔹 Key Differences

| Feature          | Static Library                 | Shared Library                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Linking Time     | Compile-time                   | Runtime (dynamic)                      |
| File Size        | Larger executable              | Smaller executable                     |
| Memory Usage     | Each process gets a copy       | Shared across processes                |
| Updating Library | Must recompile executable      | Can update library without recompiling |
| OS Dependency    | None                           | Must be present at runtime             |
| CMake Command    | `add_library(name STATIC ...)` | `add_library(name SHARED ...)`         |

---

### ✅ Summary

* **Use static libraries** for **self-contained executables** and simplicity.
* **Use shared libraries** for **modularity, smaller size, and memory efficiency**, especially in large projects like LLVM.
* In CMake, switching between **STATIC** and **SHARED** is as simple as changing `add_library` keyword.

If you want, I can create a **diagram showing memory and linking differences between static and shared libraries** — this is very useful for understanding how executables and libraries interact in large projects.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
