Absolutely, Sandeep! Let’s go step by step to **build and install a sample open-source C++ project using CMake**. We’ll use **fmt** (a popular formatting library) as an example.

---

## Step 1: Install Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git cmake build-essential
```

> On Windows, install **CMake**, **Visual Studio**, or **MSYS2** with build tools.
> On macOS, install **CMake** via Homebrew: `brew install cmake`.

---

## Step 2: Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt.git
cd fmt
```

---

## Step 3: Create a Build Directory

CMake prefers **out-of-source builds**:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

---

## Step 4: Generate Build Files Using CMake

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Explanation:

* `..` → points to the root folder containing `CMakeLists.txt`.
* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` → builds optimized release version.

You should see something like:

```
-- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 11.2.0
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /path/to/fmt/build
```

---

## Step 5: Build the Project

```bash
cmake --build . --config Release
```

* This compiles all source files.
* Equivalent to `make` on Linux.

After building, you’ll see library files:

* `libfmt.a` → static library
* `libfmt.so` → shared library

---

## Step 6: Install the Library (Optional)

```bash
sudo cmake --install .
```

* Installs headers and libraries to the system (usually `/usr/local`).
* You can now use **fmt** in other C++ projects:

```cpp
#include <fmt/core.h>

int main() {
    fmt::print("Hello, {}!\n", "world");
    return 0;
}
```

Compile with:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -lfmt -o main
./main
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, world!
```

---

## ✅ Notes

1. **Out-of-source build** keeps source folder clean.
2. Use `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/custom/path ..` to install in a custom location.
3. Use `ctest` to run tests if the project supports it:

```bash
ctest --verbose
```

4. CMake automatically handles **dependency linking**, **library types (STATIC/SHARED)**, and **installation paths**.

If you want, I can create a **diagram showing the CMake workflow for cloning, building, and installing a project** — this helps visualize the entire process for any open-source C++ project like LLVM.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
