### âœ… What is a **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**?

A **Control Flow Graph (CFG)** is a graphical representation of all paths that **might be traversed through a program during its execution**. Each node in the graph represents a **basic block** (a straight-line code sequence with no branches), and edges represent **control flow** (e.g., from one block to another via jumps, conditionals, loops).

### ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts:

* **Basic Block**: A sequence of statements with no jumps or jump targets in the middle.
* **Entry/Exit Points**: Where control enters and exits.
* **Edges**: Represent transfer of control (like from an `if`, `while`, `goto`).

### ðŸ”§ Sample C++ Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    if (x > 0) {
        cout << "Positive" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Non-positive" << endl;
    }
    cout << "Done" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### ðŸ§  CFG for the Above Code:

We'll number the **basic blocks**:

1. **B1**: `int x = 10;`
2. **B2**: `if (x > 0)`
3. **B3**: `cout << "Positive" << endl;`
4. **B4**: `cout << "Non-positive" << endl;`
5. **B5**: `cout << "Done" << endl; return 0;`

#### ðŸ“Š Control Flow:

```plaintext
       +------+
       |  B1  |
       +------+
          |
          v
       +------+
       |  B2  |------> [True] ---> +------+
       +------+                   |  B3  |
          |                      +------+
       [False]                     |
          |                        |
          v                        v
       +------+                 +------+
       |  B4  |---------------->|  B5  |
       +------+                 +------+
```

* From `B2`, we branch based on `x > 0`:

  * If `true`, go to `B3` (print "Positive")
  * If `false`, go to `B4` (print "Non-positive")
* Both `B3` and `B4` lead to `B5` (print "Done")

### ðŸ›  Tools for Visual CFG

You can generate CFGs using tools like:

* **Clang**: `clang -Xclang -analyze -Xclang -analyzer-checker=debug.DumpCFG filename.cpp`
* **LLVM**: Write a pass to print CFG
* **Online tools** like [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org) (with manual annotation)
