## âœ… What is the LLVM Pass Pipeline?

The **LLVM pass pipeline** is the **sequence of passes** (analysis or transformation) that LLVM applies to **LLVM IR** during compilation.

* Each pass can **analyze** or **transform** the IR.
* Passes can depend on **results of previous passes** (analysis passes).
* Optimizations are organized in **pipelines** to systematically improve performance and reduce code size.

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works (Step by Step)

1. **Frontend generates IR**

   * Clang converts C/C++ code to LLVM IR (`.ll` or `.bc`).

2. **Pass Manager organizes passes**

   * LLVM maintains **PassManagers** for **ModulePasses, FunctionPasses, LoopPasses**, etc.
   * Each PassManager runs passes in the correct order.

3. **Analysis passes run first**

   * Collect information **without modifying IR**.
   * Examples:

     * Control Flow Graph (CFG)
     * Dominator tree
     * Loop info

4. **Transformation passes run**

   * Modify IR to optimize or instrument code.
   * Examples:

     * Dead code elimination (DCE)
     * Constant propagation
     * Function inlining
     * Loop unrolling

5. **Pass dependencies are resolved**

   * Transformation passes can **request analysis results**.
   * LLVM ensures dependencies are computed **before the transformation runs**.

6. **IR is updated and propagated**

   * After each pass, IR may be changed.
   * Subsequent passes operate on the **latest version** of IR.

7. **Final IR is passed to code generator**

   * After all passes, IR is optimized and ready for **machine code generation**.

## ðŸ”¹ Example: Common Optimization Pipeline

```
ModulePassManager:
  1. Analysis: CFG, LoopInfo
  2. Transform: FunctionInliner
  3. Transform: DeadCodeElimination
  4. Transform: ConstantPropagation
  5. Transform: LoopUnroll
  6. Final: Lowering passes â†’ Machine code
```

* LLVM executes **passes in this order**.
* Optimizations are **iterative**; some passes may run multiple times.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Components

| Component          | Role                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Pass**           | Unit of analysis or transformation         |
| **PassManager**    | Organizes passes and handles dependencies  |
| **Analysis Pass**  | Provides information (CFG, dominators)     |
| **Transform Pass** | Modifies IR to optimize or instrument code |
| **Pipeline**       | Ordered sequence of passes applied to IR   |

---

### ðŸ”¹ Practical Notes

* Use `opt` to **experiment with the pipeline**:

```bash
opt -O2 input.bc -o output.bc
```

* `-O2` runs a **predefined optimization pipeline**.
* You can also **insert custom passes** into the pipeline.

### ðŸ’¡ Summary

1. **IR generated by frontend**
2. **PassManager schedules analysis passes**
3. **Transformation passes modify IR**
4. **Dependencies are resolved automatically**
5. **Optimized IR goes to backend for code generation**
