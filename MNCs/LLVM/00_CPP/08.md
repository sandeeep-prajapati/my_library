## ✅ What is a Pointer?

A **pointer** is a variable that **stores the memory address** of another variable.

### 🔹 Why Use Pointers?

* Access memory directly
* Efficiently pass large data structures to functions
* Dynamic memory allocation
* Foundation for data structures like linked lists, trees, etc.

---

### 📘 Syntax

```cpp
type* pointer_name;  // declare a pointer
pointer_name = &variable;  // assign address of variable
```

| Symbol | Meaning                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `*`    | Pointer declaration / dereference    |
| `&`    | Get the memory address of a variable |

---

## 🧪 Example: Print the Address of a Variable

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num = 42;         // normal variable
    int* ptr = &num;      // pointer to num

    cout << "Value of num: " << num << endl;
    cout << "Address of num: " << &num << endl;
    cout << "Pointer ptr stores: " << ptr << endl;
    cout << "Value pointed by ptr: " << *ptr << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

### 📝 Sample Output:

```
Value of num: 42
Address of num: 0x7ffeefbff5ac
Pointer ptr stores: 0x7ffeefbff5ac
Value pointed by ptr: 42
```

### 🔹 Key Points:

| Term       | Meaning                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `int* ptr` | Declares a pointer to int                        |
| `&num`     | Gets the address of `num`                        |
| `*ptr`     | Dereferences the pointer (gets value at address) |

---

### 💡 Challenge:

1. Create two integer variables.
2. Use pointers to swap their values **without using a third variable**.
