## ✅ Constructors

* A **constructor** is a special member function **called automatically** when an object is created.
* **Purpose:** Initialize object attributes.
* **Name:** Same as the class, **no return type**.

---

## ✅ Destructors

* A **destructor** is a special member function **called automatically** when an object goes out of scope or is deleted.
* **Purpose:** Clean up resources, like memory or file handles.
* **Name:** Same as class, preceded by `~`, **no return type**.

## 🧪 Example: Constructor and Destructor

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Demo {
public:
    // Constructor
    Demo() {
        cout << "Object created" << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~Demo() {
        cout << "Object destroyed" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Before creating object" << endl;
    Demo obj;  // Constructor called here
    cout << "After creating object" << endl;

    // Destructor called automatically at the end of main
    return 0;
}
```

### 📝 Sample Output:

```
Before creating object
Object created
After creating object
Object destroyed
```

### 🔹 Key Points:

| Concept         | Explanation                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Demo()`        | Constructor, runs automatically on object creation      |
| `~Demo()`       | Destructor, runs automatically when object is destroyed |
| No return type  | Constructors & destructors never return anything        |
| Automatic calls | You **don’t** call them manually in normal usage        |

### 💡 Challenge:

1. Create a class `Student` with a constructor that sets the **name** and **roll number**.
2. Destructor should print `"Student object destroyed"`.
3. Create a `Student` object and observe the output.
