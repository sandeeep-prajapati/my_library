## ✅ What are Conditional Statements in C++?

Conditional statements are used to **execute different code blocks based on conditions**.

C++ supports three main types of conditionals:

| Keyword   | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `if`      | Executes a block if condition is true             |
| `else if` | Checks additional condition if first fails        |
| `else`    | Executes if none of the above conditions are true |

## 📘 Basic Syntax

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // code runs if condition is true
} else if (another_condition) {
    // code runs if second condition is true
} else {
    // code runs if none of the above are true
}
```

## 🧪 Example: Grading System

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int marks;
    cout << "Enter your marks (0-100): ";
    cin >> marks;

    if (marks >= 90) {
        cout << "Grade: A" << endl;
    } else if (marks >= 80) {
        cout << "Grade: B" << endl;
    } else if (marks >= 70) {
        cout << "Grade: C" << endl;
    } else if (marks >= 60) {
        cout << "Grade: D" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Grade: F (Fail)" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### 📝 Sample Output:

```
Enter your marks (0-100): 75
Grade: C
```

## ✅ You Can Also Use Boolean Expressions

```cpp
int age = 20;
if (age > 18) {
    cout << "You are an adult." << endl;
} else {
    cout << "You are a minor." << endl;
}
```

## ✅ Summary

| Condition Example     | Meaning            |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `if (x == 10)`        | x is equal to 10   |
| `if (age >= 18)`      | age is 18 or older |
| `if (name != "John")` | name is not John   |

### 💡 Challenge:

Write a program that:

* Takes user input for temperature
* If temp > 30 → print `"It's hot!"`
* If temp > 20 → print `"Nice weather."`
* Else → print `"It's cold!"`
