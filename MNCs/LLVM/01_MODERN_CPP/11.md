Sure, Sandeep! Letâ€™s break down **inheritance in C++** with a clear example.

---

## âœ… What is Inheritance?

**Inheritance** allows a **class (derived class)** to **reuse properties and methods of another class (base class)**.

* Promotes **code reuse**.
* Supports **polymorphism** when combined with virtual functions.

### Types of Inheritance

1. **Single Inheritance** â€“ one base, one derived
2. **Multiple Inheritance** â€“ more than one base class
3. **Multilevel Inheritance** â€“ base â†’ derived â†’ another derived
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance** â€“ one base, multiple derived
5. **Hybrid Inheritance** â€“ combination of above

---

## ðŸ”¹ Syntax

```cpp
class Base { 
    // base class members
};

class Derived : access_specifier Base {
    // derived class members
};
```

* **Access specifier**: `public`, `protected`, or `private`.

  * `public` â†’ public members of base remain public in derived.
  * `protected` â†’ public members become protected.
  * `private` â†’ public members become private.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example: Base and Derived Class

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Animal is eating\n";
    }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Dog is barking\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog d;

    d.eat();   // inherited from Animal
    d.bark();  // defined in Dog

    return 0;
}
```

### ðŸ§¾ Output

```
Animal is eating
Dog is barking
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Points

1. `Dog` **inherits** all non-private members from `Animal`.
2. `Dog` can **add new members** (`bark()`).
3. If `Animal` had a **virtual function**, you could achieve **runtime polymorphism**.
4. Constructors and destructors:

   * **Base constructor** called first
   * **Derived constructor** called after

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example with Constructor and Destructor

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    Animal() { cout << "Animal created\n"; }
    ~Animal() { cout << "Animal destroyed\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    Dog() { cout << "Dog created\n"; }
    ~Dog() { cout << "Dog destroyed\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Dog d;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Animal created
Dog created
Dog destroyed
Animal destroyed
```

> âœ… Notice the **order** of construction and destruction.

If you want, I can make a **diagram showing memory layout and function calls for base and derived classes**, including **virtual functions**, which is very useful for understanding **LLVM-style polymorphism**.

Do you want me to do that?
