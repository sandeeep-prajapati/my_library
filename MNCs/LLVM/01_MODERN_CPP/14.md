Absolutely, Sandeep! Let’s break down **exception handling in C++** step by step.

## ✅ What is Exception Handling?

**Exception handling** is a mechanism to **detect and handle runtime errors** without crashing the program.

* Uses the keywords: `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.
* Ensures program **stability** and **graceful recovery**.

## 1️⃣ Keywords in C++

| Keyword | Description                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `try`   | Block of code to monitor for exceptions |
| `throw` | Raise an exception (signal an error)    |
| `catch` | Handle the exception                    |

---

## 2️⃣ Basic Syntax

```cpp
try {
    // code that may throw an exception
    throw 10;  // throwing an int exception
} 
catch (int e) {
    // handle int exception
    std::cout << "Caught exception: " << e << std::endl;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Caught exception: 10
```

## 3️⃣ Example: Division by Zero

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        throw runtime_error("Division by zero!");  // throw exception
    }
    return a / b;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 0;

    try {
        int result = divide(x, y);
        cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
    } 
    catch (runtime_error &e) {
        cout << "Exception: " << e.what() << endl;
    }

    cout << "Program continues..." << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Exception: Division by zero!
Program continues...
```

✅ Notice that the program **did not crash**; it caught the exception gracefully.

## 4️⃣ Multiple Catch Blocks

```cpp
try {
    throw 'A';  // char exception
}
catch (int e) {
    cout << "Int exception: " << e << endl;
}
catch (char e) {
    cout << "Char exception: " << e << endl;
}
catch (...) {  // catch-all
    cout << "Unknown exception" << endl;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Char exception: A
```

---

## 5️⃣ Key Points

1. **Throw** an object (can be int, string, or custom class).
2. **Catch** should match the type thrown.
3. Use `catch(...)` to **handle any exception**.
4. **Stack unwinding** occurs: destructors of local objects in `try` block are called automatically.
5. **Custom exception classes** can be created for more control:

```cpp
class MyException : public exception {
public:
    const char* what() const noexcept override {
        return "My custom exception!";
    }
};
```

## 6️⃣ Summary

| Concept             | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `try`               | Monitors a block for exceptions                  |
| `throw`             | Signals an exception                             |
| `catch`             | Handles the exception                            |
| Stack Unwinding     | Automatic destructor calls when exception occurs |
| Multiple Exceptions | Use multiple `catch` blocks                      |
| Catch-all           | `catch(...)` handles any type                    |

If you want, I can also make a **diagram showing exception flow, stack unwinding, and catch blocks**, which makes it very intuitive for interviews and debugging.

Do you want me to do that?
