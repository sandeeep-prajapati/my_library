Absolutely, Sandeep! **Virtual functions** and **vtables** are core concepts in C++ for **polymorphism**. Let’s break it down clearly.

## ✅ What is a Virtual Function?

A **virtual function** is a member function in a **base class** that you expect to **override in derived classes**.

* Declared using the `virtual` keyword.
* Enables **runtime (dynamic) polymorphism**.
* The **decision of which function to call** is made at **runtime**, not compile time.

---

### 🔹 Syntax

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void greet() {
        cout << "Hello from Base\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void greet() override {  // override keyword optional but recommended
        cout << "Hello from Derived\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    obj->greet();  // Calls Derived::greet due to virtual function
    delete obj;
}
```

### 🧾 Output

```
Hello from Derived
```

* Even though `obj` is of type `Base*`, the **Derived version** is called because `greet()` is virtual.

## 🔹 Why Virtual Functions?

| Feature                    | Without Virtual | With Virtual |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Function call resolution   | Compile-time    | Runtime      |
| Polymorphism               | No              | Yes          |
| Base pointer calls derived | ❌               | ✅            |

---

## ✅ How Vtables Work

**Vtable = Virtual Table**

* Compiler creates a **table of pointers** to all **virtual functions** for a class.
* Each object of the class stores a **hidden pointer (vptr)** to this table.
* At runtime, the vptr is used to **look up the correct function**.

### 🔹 Example Concept

Suppose we have:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void f1();
    virtual void f2();
};
```

* Compiler creates a **vtable**:

| vtable_Base |
| ----------- |
| &Base::f1   |
| &Base::f2   |

* If `Derived` overrides `f2`, the **vtable for Derived** becomes:

| vtable_Derived |
| -------------- |
| &Base::f1      |
| &Derived::f2   |

* Each object has a hidden **vptr** pointing to its class vtable.
* When you call `obj->f2()`, the program looks up **vptr → vtable → function pointer** → calls the right function.

---

## 🔹 Memory Layout (Simplified)

```
Base* obj = new Derived();

obj
+-----------------+
| vptr → vtable   |  // points to Derived's vtable
| other members   |
+-----------------+

Derived vtable:
+-----------------+
| &Base::f1       |
| &Derived::f2    |
+-----------------+
```

---

## ⚡ Key Points

* Only **member functions** can be virtual.
* Virtual functions incur **slight runtime overhead** due to vtable lookup.
* Use **`override` keyword** in derived class for clarity.
* If base destructor is **virtual**, derived destructors are called automatically → prevents memory leaks.

---

### 🧪 Example: Virtual Destructor

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() { cout << "Base destroyed\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived destroyed\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived();
    delete obj;  // Calls Derived destructor first, then Base
}
```

Output:

```
Derived destroyed
Base destroyed
```

> Without a virtual destructor, **Derived destructor wouldn’t be called**, leading to resource leaks.

---

✅ **Summary**

| Concept          | Description                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Virtual Function | Enables runtime polymorphism                 |
| vtable           | Table of pointers to virtual functions       |
| vptr             | Hidden pointer in object → points to vtable  |
| Runtime Dispatch | Object calls the correct overridden function |

If you want, I can make a **diagram showing vtables, vptrs, and function calls** — it’s super helpful to visualize how C++ polymorphism really works.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
