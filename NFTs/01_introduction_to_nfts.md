### ðŸ”¹ What are NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)?
**NFTs** are **unique digital assets** stored on a blockchain that represent ownership of a specific itemâ€”this could be digital art, music, videos, virtual real estate, in-game items, or even physical assets.

- **"Non-fungible"** means **not interchangeable**. Each NFT has a **unique identifier** and **metadata** that distinguishes it from any other token.

### ðŸ”¹ How NFTs differ from **traditional cryptocurrencies** (like Bitcoin, Ethereum) and **fungible tokens**:

| Feature | **NFTs** | **Traditional Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH)** | **Fungible Tokens (like USDT, BAT)** |
|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Fungibility** | Non-fungible (each token is unique) | Fungible (each unit is equal and interchangeable) | Fungible (same as traditional cryptos) |
| **Use Case** | Ownership of unique items (art, music, domain names, etc.) | Digital money, store of value | Utility tokens, stablecoins, governance |
| **Standard** | ERC-721, ERC-1155 (Ethereum) | ERC-20 (Ethereum), native coins | ERC-20 (mostly) |
| **Value Representation** | Value is subjective & based on uniqueness | Market-driven, based on supply/demand | Market-driven or pegged (e.g. stablecoins) |
| **Interchangeability** | No â€” each token is different | Yes â€” 1 BTC = 1 BTC | Yes â€” 1 USDT = 1 USDT |

### ðŸ”¹ Real-World Analogy:
- **NFT** = A rare **signed painting by Picasso** ðŸŽ¨  
- **Cryptocurrency** = **Cash** ðŸ’µ  
- **Fungible Token** = **Casino chips** of the same denomination ðŸŽ°

### ðŸ”¹ Bonus: Smart Contracts & NFTs
NFTs are often powered by **smart contracts** which help manage ownership, transferability, and royalties. For example, an artist can get a **percentage of resale** every time their NFT changes hands.
