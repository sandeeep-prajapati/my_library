
### **1. Inertia.js Basics**
1. Set up a Laravel project with Inertia.js and integrate React as the frontend framework.
2. Create a basic Laravel route and return an Inertia response that renders a React component.
3. Implement a simple page using Inertia.js to render a React component on the frontend.
4. Set up **Inertia Link** and use it to navigate between pages in a single-page app (SPA).
5. Build a basic Inertia app with multiple pages, passing data from Laravel controllers to React components.

### **2. Working with Inertia and React**
6. Create an Inertia page component in React that accepts props from the Laravel backend.
7. Pass data from a Laravel controller to a React component using Inertia's `Inertia::render()` method.
8. Handle dynamic routing using Inertia's `inertia-react` with React Router for complex page routing.
9. Implement a React component that performs client-side form validation before submitting data to a Laravel backend.
10. Build a dynamic table using Inertia to pass data from Laravel to React and allow pagination.

### **3. Handling Forms and Submissions**
11. Create a form in React using Inertia.js to submit data back to the Laravel controller.
12. Implement client-side form validation in React using Inertia.js.
13. Handle form submission errors (validation, server errors) and display them on the frontend using Inertia.
14. Implement a file upload feature using Inertia and React, handling both the frontend and backend logic.
15. Use **Inertia Form Helper** in React to manage form submissions with automatic error handling.

### **4. Advanced State Management**
16. Use **Inertia's shared data** to share common data across multiple pages in React components.
17. Set up global state management in React with **Context API** or **Redux**, and pass state data between components using Inertia.
18. Implement **Inertia Flash Messages** in React to display temporary notifications after actions like form submission.
19. Use **Inertia Errors** in React to display error messages received from the backend after form submission or validation failure.
20. Use **Inertia progress indicators** in React for showing loading states when submitting data to the backend.

### **5. Interactivity and Dynamic Features**
21. Create a React component with Inertia that dynamically fetches data from Laravel without reloading the page (AJAX requests).
22. Use **Inertia::location()** in Laravel to get the current URL or query parameters in your React component.
23. Implement client-side dynamic data updates (e.g., creating or deleting items in a list) with Inertia, updating the backend, and reflecting changes in the frontend.
24. Use **Inertia.replace()** to update data on the current page without navigating away or reloading.
25. Create a live search feature using React and Inertia, where search results are fetched from Laravel without a full page reload.

### **6. Authentication and Authorization**
26. Implement user authentication using Laravel, Inertia.js, and React, ensuring session management and login flow.
27. Protect pages and routes in Inertia using React and Laravel authentication middleware to ensure only authorized users can access them.
28. Use **Inertia::share()** to share authentication status (e.g., logged-in user) globally to React components.
29. Implement a logout button in React using Inertia.js to send a request to the Laravel backend to log out the user and redirect.
30. Handle role-based authorization in React with Inertia, checking user roles and permissions before rendering certain components.
