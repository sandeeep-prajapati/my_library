Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up a new Django project and create an app to display "Hello, World!" on the homepage:

---

### **Step 1: Install Django**
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install Django.  
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate    # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install Django
pip install django
```

---

### **Step 2: Create a New Django Project**
Run the following command to start a new Django project:  
```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```

---

### **Step 3: Create a Django App**
Inside the project, create an app named `hello`:  
```bash
python manage.py startapp hello
```

---

### **Step 4: Register the App**
Add the app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `myproject/settings.py`:  
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'hello',
]
```

---

### **Step 5: Create a View**
In `hello/views.py`, define a simple view to return "Hello, World!":  
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello_world(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
```

---

### **Step 6: Define a URL Pattern**
Create a `urls.py` file in the `hello` app directory:  
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import hello_world

urlpatterns = [
    path('', hello_world, name='hello_world'),
]
```

---

### **Step 7: Connect App URLs to the Project**
In `myproject/urls.py`, include the `hello` app’s URLs:  
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('hello.urls')),  # Connects to the hello app
]
```

---

### **Step 8: Run the Development Server**
Run the Django development server:  
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

---

### **Step 9: View the Homepage**
Open a web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/). You should see:  
```
Hello, World!
```

---

### **Optional Enhancements**
- Add an HTML template to improve styling.
- Use Django's template engine to make the response dynamic.
