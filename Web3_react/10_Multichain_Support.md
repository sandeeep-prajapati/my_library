# Adding Multi-Blockchain Support to a dApp

To support multiple blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana in a single dApp, you'll need to implement several key components:

## Core Architecture

1. **Multi-Chain Wallet Integration**
   - Use wallets like MetaMask (EVM chains) and Phantom (Solana) or wallet aggregators like WalletConnect
   - Detect which blockchain the user's wallet is connected to

2. **Chain-Agnostic Frontend**
   - Create UI components that adapt to different chains
   - Display appropriate tokens/contracts based on selected chain

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Smart Contract Deployment
- Deploy identical contract logic on each supported chain
- Use proxy patterns or upgradeable contracts to maintain consistency

### 2. Chain-Specific Adapters
```javascript
// Example adapter pattern
class EthereumAdapter {
  constructor(provider) {
    this.web3 = new Web3(provider);
  }
  
  async getBalance(address) {
    return this.web3.eth.getBalance(address);
  }
}

class SolanaAdapter {
  constructor(connection) {
    this.connection = connection;
  }
  
  async getBalance(address) {
    return this.connection.getBalance(new PublicKey(address));
  }
}
```

### 3. Unified API Layer
- Create backend services that abstract chain differences
- Route requests to appropriate chain RPC based on parameters

## Key Technical Considerations

1. **Transaction Handling**
   - EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon) use similar transaction structures
   - Solana has different transaction model (fee payer, instructions)

2. **State Management**
   - Track user's selected chain in app state
   - Handle chain switches gracefully

3. **Gas/Transaction Fees**
   - Different fee models (EVM gas vs. Solana lamports)
   - Display appropriate fee estimations

4. **Token Standards**
   - EVM: ERC-20, ERC-721
   - Solana: SPL tokens

## Tools & Libraries

- **Ethereum/Polygon**: ethers.js, web3.js
- **Solana**: @solana/web3.js, @project-serum/anchor
- **Multi-chain**: Web3Modal, Web3React, RainbowKit

## Example Implementation Flow

1. User connects wallet
2. Detect supported chains from wallet
3. Present chain selector if multiple available
4. Load appropriate contract ABIs/addresses for selected chain
5. Route all transactions through chain-specific adapters

## Challenges to Address

- Different finality times across chains
- Varying confirmation requirements
- Chain reorganization handling
- Cross-chain communication (if needed)
