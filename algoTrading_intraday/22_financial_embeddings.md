To use **FinBERT embeddings** for clustering financial news articles into thematic groups like **inflation**, **earnings**, and other relevant financial themes, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Data Collection**
First, gather a dataset of financial news articles. You can scrape news websites using **BeautifulSoup**, use financial news APIs, or collect articles from sources like **Yahoo Finance**, **Reuters**, **Bloomberg**, etc.

For this example, let's assume you already have a dataset of financial news articles in the form of a list of texts.

### 2. **Preprocessing the Text Data**
You need to preprocess the financial news articles, which includes tasks like removing unwanted characters, tokenizing, and possibly lowercasing.

### 3. **Extracting Embeddings using FinBERT**
You can use **FinBERT**, a pre-trained model fine-tuned on financial data, to generate embeddings for each news article. These embeddings will capture the semantic meaning of the articles and allow you to cluster them into thematic groups.

Here’s how you can do this using **Hugging Face Transformers** and **PyTorch**:

#### Step 1: Install the required libraries
```bash
pip install transformers torch sklearn
```

#### Step 2: Load the FinBERT model and tokenizer
```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

# Load FinBERT
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert')

# Function to generate embeddings from FinBERT
def get_finbert_embeddings(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).squeeze().numpy()  # Average embeddings over all tokens
```

#### Step 3: Get embeddings for all news articles
Assuming you have a list of financial news articles (`news_articles`), generate embeddings for each article:

```python
# Example list of financial news articles
news_articles = [
    "The inflation rate has risen by 0.5% in the last quarter.",
    "Company ABC reports earnings beating expectations by 10%.",
    "The Fed announces interest rate hike to curb inflation."
    # Add more articles here...
]

# Get embeddings for each article
embeddings = [get_finbert_embeddings(article) for article in news_articles]
```

### 4. **Clustering the News Articles**
Now that you have the **embeddings** for each article, you can use a clustering algorithm like **KMeans** or **DBSCAN** to group the articles into thematic clusters.

#### Step 1: Install the required libraries
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

#### Step 2: Perform clustering using KMeans
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Convert embeddings list into a numpy array
embeddings_array = np.array(embeddings)

# Perform KMeans clustering
num_clusters = 3  # You can adjust this based on the number of themes you expect
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(embeddings_array)

# Print the cluster assignments for each article
for idx, article in enumerate(news_articles):
    print(f"Article: {article}")
    print(f"Cluster: {clusters[idx]}")
    print()
```

#### Step 3: Visualize the clustering results (Optional)
If you want to visualize the clustering results, you can reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings using **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) and plot them:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Reduce dimensions to 2D for visualization
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
reduced_embeddings = pca.fit_transform(embeddings_array)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(reduced_embeddings[:, 0], reduced_embeddings[:, 1], c=clusters, cmap='viridis')
plt.title("Clustering of Financial News Articles")
plt.xlabel("PCA Component 1")
plt.ylabel("PCA Component 2")
plt.colorbar(label='Cluster')
plt.show()
```

### 5. **Interpreting the Results**
After performing clustering, you will have articles grouped into clusters. To better understand what each cluster represents, you can analyze the **top keywords** in each cluster or review a few articles in each cluster to identify common themes (like inflation, earnings, etc.).

Here’s how to identify the top keywords for each cluster using the embeddings:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Perform TF-IDF vectorization to extract keywords
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(news_articles)

# For each cluster, find the top keywords
n_top_keywords = 5
for cluster_num in range(num_clusters):
    print(f"\nCluster {cluster_num} Top Keywords:")
    cluster_articles = [news_articles[idx] for idx in range(len(news_articles)) if clusters[idx] == cluster_num]
    cluster_tfidf = X[[i for i, _ in enumerate(news_articles) if clusters[i] == cluster_num]]
    
    # Get the top TF-IDF keywords for this cluster
    avg_tfidf = cluster_tfidf.mean(axis=0).A1
    feature_names = np.array(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
    top_indices = avg_tfidf.argsort()[-n_top_keywords:][::-1]
    top_keywords = feature_names[top_indices]
    
    print(", ".join(top_keywords))
```

### 6. **Summary**
This approach uses **FinBERT embeddings** to represent the semantic meaning of financial news articles and then applies **KMeans clustering** to group them into thematic clusters like **inflation**, **earnings**, etc. 

The results can be visualized and interpreted by examining the top keywords in each cluster, providing insights into the key topics covered in financial news. You can adjust the number of clusters and fine-tune your preprocessing steps to improve clustering accuracy and thematic grouping.

### Optional Enhancements:
- **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune **FinBERT** further on your own financial corpus if you have a large labeled dataset.
- **Other Clustering Algorithms**: Try using **DBSCAN** or **Agglomerative Clustering** for potentially better results, especially if the number of clusters is unknown.
