To analyze the impact of major events (like earnings reports, policy changes, etc.) on stock prices using **FinBERT sentiment analysis**, you can follow a structured approach that combines the extraction of relevant event data, sentiment analysis, and stock price behavior analysis. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### **Step 1: Define the Event of Interest**
Identify the type of major events that you want to track. Some common examples include:
- **Earnings reports**: A company's quarterly or annual financial performance.
- **Policy changes**: New laws, regulations, or monetary policies that can affect the market or a specific sector.
- **Acquisitions/Mergers**: News about companies merging or being acquired.
- **Product launches**: Major product or service releases.
- **Market disruptions**: Natural disasters, pandemics, or geopolitical events.

### **Step 2: Collect Event Data**
You need to gather relevant news articles, press releases, and tweets that mention the event and its impact on stock prices. This data can be collected from various sources:
- **News websites**: Use web scraping tools like `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` to scrape news articles related to the event.
- **Twitter**: Use the **Twitter API** to collect tweets mentioning the event or specific stock tickers.
- **Company press releases**: Collect press releases from the company’s website or news platforms.
  
For the example, let's focus on scraping news articles using web scraping libraries or fetching tweets.

### **Step 3: Perform Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT**
Use **FinBERT** (a variant of BERT fine-tuned on financial text) to perform sentiment analysis on the collected textual data. Sentiment analysis will classify the event-related texts as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. This can help gauge the market’s sentiment about the event.

#### **Install FinBERT**
First, install the necessary libraries and dependencies:
```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

#### **Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT**

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import torch

# Load FinBERT model and tokenizer
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert-tone')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert-tone')

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits = outputs.logits
    sentiment = torch.argmax(logits, dim=1).item()

    sentiment_labels = ["negative", "neutral", "positive"]
    return sentiment_labels[sentiment]
```

You can use the `analyze_sentiment` function to process news articles or tweets to classify their sentiment.

### **Step 4: Collect Historical Stock Data**
Use the **Zerodha Kite API** to fetch historical stock price data for the relevant stock. The price movements around the time of the event will help determine the market reaction.

```python
from kiteconnect import KiteConnect
import pandas as pd

kite = KiteConnect(api_key="your_api_key")

def fetch_stock_data(stock_symbol, start_date, end_date):
    """ Fetch historical stock data from Zerodha Kite API """
    data = kite.historical_data(stock_symbol, start_date, end_date, "day")
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Example: Fetch stock data for the last 30 days
df = fetch_stock_data("RELIANCE", "2024-12-01", "2024-12-31")
```

### **Step 5: Analyze the Impact of Events on Stock Prices**
Now, you have sentiment data from FinBERT and stock price data. The next step is to perform a correlation analysis between sentiment scores and stock price movements.

1. **Determine Sentiment**: After analyzing the news articles or tweets about the event, classify the sentiment as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
2. **Match Sentiment with Stock Prices**: You will compare the sentiment of the news with the stock price behavior on the same days or a short period around the event. For example, you can analyze the stock price 1-3 days before and after the event.

#### **Combine Sentiment and Price Data**
Create a function to calculate the correlation between sentiment and stock prices. For simplicity, you can assume that a **positive sentiment** leads to a price increase, while **negative sentiment** leads to a price drop.

```python
def calculate_price_impact(sentiment, stock_data, event_date):
    """ Calculate the impact of sentiment on stock prices """
    # Find the stock price on the event date
    event_price = stock_data[stock_data['date'] == event_date]['close'].iloc[0]

    # Check price movement before and after the event
    before_price = stock_data[stock_data['date'] == (event_date - pd.Timedelta(days=1))]['close'].iloc[0]
    after_price = stock_data[stock_data['date'] == (event_date + pd.Timedelta(days=1))]['close'].iloc[0]

    # Determine the price change after the event
    price_change = after_price - before_price

    # Compare sentiment and price movement
    sentiment_impact = "No significant impact"
    if sentiment == "positive" and price_change > 0:
        sentiment_impact = "Positive impact"
    elif sentiment == "negative" and price_change < 0:
        sentiment_impact = "Negative impact"
    elif sentiment == "neutral" and abs(price_change) < 0.01:
        sentiment_impact = "Neutral impact"

    return sentiment_impact, price_change
```

### **Step 6: Analyze the Results**
You can now analyze multiple events by collecting sentiment data and comparing it with price changes. This can be done using a Pandas DataFrame, where you store the results of sentiment analysis, stock prices, and calculated impacts.

```python
import pandas as pd

events = [
    {"date": "2024-12-05", "event": "Earnings Report", "sentiment": "positive"},
    {"date": "2024-12-12", "event": "Policy Change", "sentiment": "negative"},
]

# List to store results
results = []

# Loop through events and calculate price impacts
for event in events:
    sentiment = event["sentiment"]
    event_date = pd.to_datetime(event["date"])

    sentiment_impact, price_change = calculate_price_impact(sentiment, df, event_date)
    results.append({
        "event": event["event"],
        "sentiment": sentiment,
        "price_change": price_change,
        "impact": sentiment_impact
    })

# Convert results to DataFrame for analysis
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)
print(results_df)
```

### **Step 7: Visualization**
You can visualize the impact of events and sentiments on stock prices using `matplotlib` or `plotly` to create charts showing price changes before and after the event, along with the sentiment.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot price movement and sentiment
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax.plot(df['date'], df['close'], label="Stock Price", color='blue')
ax.axvline(x=pd.to_datetime("2024-12-05"), color='green', linestyle='--', label="Event: Earnings Report")
ax.axvline(x=pd.to_datetime("2024-12-12"), color='red', linestyle='--', label="Event: Policy Change")

plt.title('Stock Price Movement and Event Impact')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Stock Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### **Step 8: Conclusion**
Through the above steps, you can:
1. **Collect event-related news and tweets**.
2. **Perform sentiment analysis** using **FinBERT**.
3. **Fetch historical stock price data**.
4. **Analyze the correlation between sentiment** and **price movements**.
5. **Visualize the impact of major events** on stock prices.

This approach provides valuable insights into how different types of events (such as earnings reports, policy changes) affect stock prices based on market sentiment. You can further enhance this by adding more advanced statistical analysis or machine learning models to predict future price movements based on sentiment.
