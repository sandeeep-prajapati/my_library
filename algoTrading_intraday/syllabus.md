16. **16_event_sentiment_impact.md**  
    - Analyze the impact of major events (e.g., earnings reports, policy changes) on stock prices using FinBERT sentiment analysis.

17. **17_trade_journal.md**  
    - Create a Django-based trade journal to log trades, record rationales, and track performance over time.

18. **18_stock_selection.md**  
    - Develop a stock selection model using deep reinforcement learning. Display suggested stocks on the Django platform.

19. **19_scalping_strategy.md**  
    - Implement a scalping strategy by leveraging real-time price data and quick sentiment analysis.

20. **20_trading_alerts.md**  
    - Set up a Django notification system that sends alerts for potential trades based on predefined conditions.

21. **21_multi_asset_model.md**  
    - Train a deep learning model to handle multiple asset classes (stocks, commodities, ETFs) and generate diversified trade signals.

22. **22_financial_embeddings.md**  
    - Use FinBERT embeddings to cluster financial news articles into thematic groups (e.g., inflation, earnings).

23. **23_high_frequency_trading.md**  
    - Develop a Django-integrated high-frequency trading system with basic latency optimization techniques.
