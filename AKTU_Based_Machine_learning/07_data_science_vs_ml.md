### **Notes on Data Science vs. Machine Learning**

---

#### **1. Definition**  
- **Data Science:**  
  - A multidisciplinary field focused on extracting insights and knowledge from data using statistics, data analysis, and machine learning.  
  - Involves cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing data to solve business problems.  

- **Machine Learning:**  
  - A subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating algorithms that learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.  

---

#### **2. Key Objectives**  
- **Data Science:**  
  - Data Wrangling: Cleaning and preparing data.  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data through visualization and descriptive statistics.  
  - Business Insights: Using statistical techniques to provide actionable insights.  

- **Machine Learning:**  
  - Automating predictions or decisions.  
  - Training models to identify patterns and generalize to unseen data.  
  - Optimizing algorithms for accuracy and efficiency.

#### **3. Tools and Techniques**  
- **Data Science:**  
  - Programming: Python, R, SQL.  
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
  - Techniques: Hypothesis testing, regression, and clustering.  

- **Machine Learning:**  
  - Programming: Python, Julia, MATLAB.  
  - Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

### **Prompt: Analyze a Dataset in Python and Explain How ML Models Improve Predictions**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Load the dataset
# Example dataset: Housing prices
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows
print("Dataset Head:\n", data.head())

# Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
print("\nDataset Info:")
print(data.info())

# Check for missing values
print("\nMissing Values:\n", data.isnull().sum())

# Summary statistics
print("\nSummary Statistics:\n", data.describe())

# Visualize relationships
plt.scatter(data["sepal_length"], data["petal_length"])
plt.title("Sepal Length vs Petal Length")
plt.xlabel("Sepal Length")
plt.ylabel("Petal Length")
plt.show()

# Step 2: Feature Selection and Preprocessing
# Selecting features and target variable
X = data[["sepal_length", "sepal_width", "petal_width"]]
y = data["petal_length"]

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 3: Machine Learning Model
# Train a Linear Regression Model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("\nModel Performance:")
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")
print(f"R2 Score: {r2:.2f}")

# Visualization of Predictions
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
plt.title("Actual vs Predicted")
plt.xlabel("Actual Petal Length")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Petal Length")
plt.show()

# Step 4: ML Model Impact
# Improved predictions using ML
print("\nImpact of ML Model:")
print("- The regression model identifies relationships between features and target variables.")
print("- It provides more accurate predictions compared to simple averages or manual estimates.")
print("- Example use case: Predicting flower characteristics for new samples.")
```

### **Explanation of Code**

1. **Data Analysis:**  
   - The dataset is loaded, inspected, and visualized using scatter plots and statistical summaries.  

2. **Feature Selection:**  
   - Specific features (`sepal_length`, `sepal_width`, `petal_width`) are chosen to predict `petal_length`.  

3. **Model Training:**  
   - Linear Regression is used to train a predictive model on the training data.  

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R2 Score** evaluate how well the model predicts unseen data.  

5. **Visualization of Results:**  
   - Scatter plots of actual vs. predicted values show the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.  

6. **ML Model Impact:**  
   - By leveraging machine learning, predictions are significantly more reliable and scalable than traditional methods.  

This practical example demonstrates how machine learning complements data science tasks, transitioning from descriptive analysis to predictive modeling.
