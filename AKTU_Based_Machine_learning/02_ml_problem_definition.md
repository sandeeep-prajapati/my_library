### **Notes on Well-Defined Learning Problems**

---

#### **Definition**  
A learning problem is considered well-defined when the following components are explicitly specified:  
1. **Task (T):** The specific objective the model is designed to achieve.  
2. **Performance (P):** The metric used to evaluate the model's success on the task.  
3. **Experience (E):** The dataset or feedback used to train the model.  

---

#### **Characteristics of a Well-Defined Learning Problem**  
1. **Clear Objective:** The task is clearly defined, e.g., classification, regression, clustering, etc.  
2. **Measurable Metric:** A performance metric is explicitly chosen to evaluate the system, e.g., accuracy, mean squared error, etc.  
3. **Training Data:** Sufficient and relevant data is provided to enable the system to learn.

#### **Examples of Well-Defined Learning Problems**

1. **Spam Email Detection:**  
   - **Task (T):** Classify emails as spam or not spam.  
   - **Performance (P):** Accuracy of classification.  
   - **Experience (E):** Historical labeled emails with spam and non-spam labels.

2. **House Price Prediction:**  
   - **Task (T):** Predict the price of a house based on features like area, location, and number of rooms.  
   - **Performance (P):** Mean squared error between predicted and actual prices.  
   - **Experience (E):** Historical data of houses with features and corresponding prices.

3. **Self-Driving Cars:**  
   - **Task (T):** Navigate a car from one location to another without human intervention.  
   - **Performance (P):** Number of successful trips without accidents.  
   - **Experience (E):** Driving data collected through sensors, cameras, and human demonstrations.

### **PyTorch Program: Predicting House Prices Using Regression**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Generate synthetic data for house prices
# Features: [Size in sqft, Number of bedrooms]
# Target: [Price in $1000s]
X = torch.tensor([[1400, 3], [1600, 3], [1700, 4], [1875, 4], [1100, 2]], dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor([[245], [312], [279], [308], [199]], dtype=torch.float32)

# Normalize the data
X_mean, X_std = X.mean(0), X.std(0)
X = (X - X_mean) / X_std
y_mean, y_std = y.mean(0), y.std(0)
y = (y - y_mean) / y_std

# Define the regression model
class HousePriceModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(HousePriceModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(2, 1)  # Two input features, one output

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer
model = HousePriceModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 1000
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Forward pass
    predictions = model(X)
    loss = criterion(predictions, y)

    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    # Print loss every 100 epochs
    if (epoch + 1) % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

# Test the model
test_data = torch.tensor([[1500, 3], [1200, 2]], dtype=torch.float32)
test_data = (test_data - X_mean) / X_std  # Normalize test data
predicted_prices = model(test_data) * y_std + y_mean  # De-normalize predictions
print("Predicted Prices (in $1000s):", predicted_prices.detach().numpy())
```

### **Explanation of the Program**

1. **Data:**  
   Synthetic data of houses with features (size, number of bedrooms) and corresponding prices.  

2. **Normalization:**  
   Both input features and target outputs are normalized to ensure stability during training.  

3. **Model:**  
   A simple linear regression model with two input features and one output.  

4. **Loss Function:**  
   Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure the difference between predicted and actual prices.  

5. **Training Loop:**  
   The model is trained for 1000 epochs using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize the loss function.  

6. **Testing:**  
   The trained model predicts prices for new houses, and the predictions are de-normalized to return actual price values.
