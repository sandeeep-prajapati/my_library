### **Notes on Learning**

---

#### **Definition of Learning**  
Learning is the process by which a system improves its performance on a specific task based on experience. In the context of machine learning, it involves designing algorithms that allow computers to learn patterns, make decisions, or make predictions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

#### **Key Components of Learning**  
1. **Task (T):** The problem the system is trying to solve (e.g., recognizing images, translating text).  
2. **Performance (P):** A measurable metric for evaluating how well the system performs the task (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).  
3. **Experience (E):** Data or feedback used to improve the system's performance.

#### **Types of Learning**  
Machine learning can be broadly categorized into the following types:

---

### **1. Supervised Learning**  
- **Definition:**  
  The model is trained on labeled data, where each input is paired with a corresponding output label.  
- **Objective:**  
  Learn a mapping function \( f: X \rightarrow Y \), where \( X \) is input data and \( Y \) is the output label.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **Classification:** Identifying spam emails.  
  - **Regression:** Predicting house prices.  

---

### **2. Unsupervised Learning**  
- **Definition:**  
  The model is trained on unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures within the data.  
- **Objective:**  
  Discover groupings, associations, or representations in the input data.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **Clustering:** Grouping customers by purchasing behavior.  
  - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information.

### **3. Reinforcement Learning**  
- **Definition:**  
  The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.  
- **Objective:**  
  Maximize cumulative rewards over time by taking optimal actions.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Training a robot to navigate a maze.  
  - Teaching an agent to play a game like chess or Atari.

### **PyTorch Simulation Examples**

#### **1. Supervised Learning: Linear Regression Example**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Generate synthetic data
x = torch.rand(100, 1)
y = 3 * x + 2 + 0.1 * torch.randn(100, 1)

# Define a simple linear regression model
model = nn.Linear(1, 1)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(1000):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    predictions = model(x)
    loss = criterion(predictions, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print(f"Trained model parameters: {list(model.parameters())}")
```

---

#### **2. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Example**
```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic data
data, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.6, random_state=42)

# Apply KMeans clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4)
kmeans.fit(data)

# Plot results
plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], color='red')
plt.show()
```

---

#### **3. Reinforcement Learning: Q-Learning Example**
```python
import numpy as np

# Define environment
states = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
actions = ['left', 'right']
rewards = {'A': {'right': 10}, 'B': {'left': -1, 'right': 5}, 'C': {'left': 0, 'right': 1}, 'D': {}}

# Initialize Q-table
q_table = {state: {action: 0 for action in actions} for state in states}

# Parameters
alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
gamma = 0.9  # Discount factor
episodes = 1000

# Training loop
for _ in range(episodes):
    state = np.random.choice(states)
    while state in rewards:
        action = np.random.choice(actions)
        reward = rewards[state].get(action, 0)
        next_state = states[(states.index(state) + 1) % len(states)]
        q_table[state][action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * max(q_table[next_state].values()) - q_table[state][action])
        state = next_state

print(f"Trained Q-table: {q_table}")
```
