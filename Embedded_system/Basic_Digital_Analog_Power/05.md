### **Truth Table: NMOS and PMOS as Switches**

#### **NMOS Transistor Behavior**

| Gate (G) | Source (S) | Drain (D)    | Switch (ON/OFF) |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| HIGH     | 0V         | connected    | ON              |
| LOW      | 0V         | disconnected | OFF             |

#### **PMOS Transistor Behavior**

| Gate (G) | Source (S)     | Drain (D)    | Switch (ON/OFF) |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| LOW      | V<sub>DD</sub> | connected    | ON              |
| HIGH     | V<sub>DD</sub> | disconnected | OFF             |

### **CMOS Inverter Using PMOS and NMOS**

A **CMOS inverter** is a combination of a **PMOS** on the top and an **NMOS** at the bottom.

#### **CMOS Inverter Logic**

| Input (Vin) | PMOS | NMOS | Output (Vout) |
| ----------- | ---- | ---- | ------------- |
| 0 (LOW)     | ON   | OFF  | 1 (HIGH)      |
| 1 (HIGH)    | OFF  | ON   | 0 (LOW)       |

This setup creates:

* **Low power dissipation**, since only one transistor conducts at a time.
* **Rail-to-rail output swing**.
* **High noise margins**.

### **Gate-Level Examples**

#### **1. NMOS Pull-Down**

```txt
         VDD
          |
          |
         ---    <- Not used in NMOS-only logic
         ---
          |
     Vin ----->| NMOS
          |
         GND
```

* Logic "1" at `Vin` turns NMOS ON → output pulled to GND.
* Logic "0" at `Vin` turns NMOS OFF → output floating or pulled-up.

#### **2. CMOS Inverter**

```txt
         VDD
          |
         PMOS
          |
          +----- Vout
          |
         NMOS
          |
         GND
```

* PMOS gate and NMOS gate tied to `Vin`.
* `Vin = 0` → PMOS ON, NMOS OFF → `Vout = 1`
* `Vin = 1` → PMOS OFF, NMOS ON → `Vout = 0`

---

### **Conclusion**

* **PMOS** is best for **pull-up** due to its nature of conducting when the gate is low.
* **NMOS** is ideal for **pull-down** because it conducts when the gate is high.
* **CMOS** technology uses both to create efficient, fast, and low-power digital circuits.
