## 🎯 Goal:

* Define custom routes inside your **package**.
* Load them automatically using `loadRoutesFrom()` in the service provider.
* Access them via browser or API without changing the main Laravel app routes.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

---

### 📁 1. Create the Route File in the Package

Inside your package:

```bash
mkdir -p packages/sandeep/mytools/routes
touch packages/sandeep/mytools/routes/web.php
```

---

### ✏️ 2. Define Routes

In `packages/sandeep/mytools/routes/web.php`:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::prefix('mytools')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/greet/{name}', function ($name) {
        return mytools_greet($name); // Using helper from Prompt 4
    });

    Route::get('/view/{name}', function ($name) {
        return view('mytools::greet', [
            'name' => ucfirst($name),
            'greeting' => config('mytools.greeting_prefix', 'Hello')
        ]);
    });
});
```

---

### ⚙️ 3. Load Route File in `MyToolsServiceProvider`

Update `boot()` method:

```php
public function boot()
{
    // Load the routes from the package
    $this->loadRoutesFrom(__DIR__.'/../routes/web.php');

    // Other stuff: config, views, migrations, etc.
}
```

> `loadRoutesFrom()` ensures routes are loaded only when the app is not cached.

---

### 🧪 4. Test in Browser

Start your Laravel server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Now test your routes:

#### ✅ Greet Helper Route:

```
http://localhost:8000/mytools/greet/Sandeep
```

#### ✅ Blade View Route:

```
http://localhost:8000/mytools/view/Sandeep
```

---

### 💡 Optional: Create API Routes

You can also add `api.php`:

```bash
touch packages/sandeep/mytools/routes/api.php
```

Then register:

```php
$this->loadRoutesFrom(__DIR__.'/../routes/api.php');
```

Define API routes using:

```php
Route::middleware('api')->prefix('api/mytools')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/ping', fn () => response()->json(['pong' => true]));
});
```

## ✅ Summary

| ✅ Task             | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `routes/web.php`   | Holds your package's web routes     |
| `loadRoutesFrom()` | Registers package routes            |
| `Route::prefix()`  | Makes routes isolated and organized |
| Usage              | Access via `/mytools/greet/{name}`  |
