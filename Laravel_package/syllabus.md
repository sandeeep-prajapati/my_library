### 🚀 **Beginner Level: Core Package Structure**

1. **Create a basic Laravel package manually (without using a generator)** that registers a service provider and facade.
2. **Configure `composer.json`** for PSR-4 autoloading and make your package installable via `composer require`.
3. **Add config file support** in your package and allow users to publish it using `php artisan vendor:publish`.
4. **Add a helper function or class in your package** and make it globally accessible.
5. **Create and register routes within your package** using a separate route file.

### 🛠️ **Intermediate Level: Features, Commands, and Views**

6. **Add custom Blade views** to your package and make them publishable and override-ready.
7. **Register an Artisan command** from your package and run it globally like `php artisan mypackage:command`.
8. **Include package migrations** and allow publishing via `vendor:publish --tag=migrations`.
9. **Use Laravel’s container binding** to bind interfaces to implementations inside your package.
10. **Add Middleware to your package** and register it in the host Laravel app dynamically.

### 🔧 **Advanced Level: Auto Installation, Events, and Publishing**

11. **Create an auto-installer using ServiceProvider boot methods** that handles automatic publishing, migration, etc.
12. **Use Laravel Events in your package** to listen and react to events like user login or model saving.
13. **Write unit tests for your package** using PHPUnit and integrate with GitHub Actions for CI.
14. **Use Laravel's `PackageServiceProvider` class** (if using Laravel >= 8.0) to simplify registration.
15. **Add seeders, factories, and models** to your package and make them usable from the main app.

### 🧩 **Expert Level: Plugin/Modular System & SaaS**

16. **Build a plugin architecture** using Laravel's `Module` approach or custom plugin loader in your package.
17. **Make your package SaaS-ready** by handling tenant-aware logic (e.g., subdomains, user-based restrictions).
18. **Allow dynamic plugin activation/deactivation** from the database (like WordPress plugins).
19. **Create a package that installs and configures itself using a wizard UI** during `php artisan install`.
20. **Distribute your package via Packagist or Private Satis server** and protect premium features using license keys or tokens.
