### **Types of Product Managers**
1. **Technical Product Manager (TPM)**  
   - Focuses on deeply technical products (e.g., APIs, infrastructure, AI/ML).  
   - Works closely with engineers and may have a coding background.  
   - More common in B2B, SaaS, or enterprise tech companies.  

2. **Growth Product Manager**  
   - Optimizes user acquisition, retention, and monetization.  
   - Runs A/B tests, analyzes funnels, and experiments with pricing.  
   - Common in consumer tech (e.g., e-commerce, social media).  

3. **Data Product Manager**  
   - Specializes in data-driven products (analytics platforms, recommendation engines).  
   - Works with data scientists and BI teams.  

4. **Platform Product Manager**  
   - Manages internal or external platforms (APIs, developer tools).  
   - Ensures scalability, security, and third-party integrations.  

5. **B2B vs. B2C Product Manager**  
   - **B2B PMs** focus on enterprise needs, long sales cycles, and stakeholder alignment.  
   - **B2C PMs** prioritize user experience, rapid experimentation, and mass adoption.  

6. **AI/ML Product Manager**  
   - Works on AI-driven products (chatbots, predictive analytics).  
   - Balances technical feasibility with business value.

### **Startups vs. Enterprises: How PM Roles Differ**  

| **Aspect**               | **Startup PM**                          | **Enterprise PM**                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**                | Wears multiple hats (PM + UX + Biz Dev) | Specialized role (e.g., TPM, Growth PM) |
| **Decision-Making**      | Fast, autonomous, founder-driven       | Slower, consensus-driven, stakeholder-heavy |
| **Resources**            | Limited budget, lean teams             | Larger budgets, dedicated teams (e.g., legal, compliance) |
| **Risk Tolerance**       | High (experiment, pivot quickly)       | Low (risk-averse, incremental improvements) |
| **Metrics**              | Growth, engagement, survival           | Revenue, market share, scalability       |
| **Stakeholders**         | Fewer (CEO, small team)                | Many (legal, sales, engineering, execs) |
| **Process**              | Agile, scrappy, minimal documentation  | Structured (SAFe, PRDs, OKRs)           |
| **Innovation**           | Builds from scratch, disruptive ideas  | Optimizes existing products, incremental innovation |

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Startup PMs** are generalists who move fast, prioritize survival, and often work directly with founders.  
- **Enterprise PMs** are specialists who navigate complex structures, compliance, and long-term strategy.  
- The type of PM role (technical, growth, B2B, etc.) further defines responsibilities, regardless of company size.
