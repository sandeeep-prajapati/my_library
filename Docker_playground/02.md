## 📁 Project Structure (Very Important)

First, your folder should look like this:

```
project-root/
├── docker-compose.yml
└── html/
    └── index.html
```

---

## 📄 `docker-compose.yml` (With Volume Mount)

version: "3.9"

services:
nginx:
image: nginx:latest
container_name: nginx_basic
ports:
- "8080:80"
volumes:
- ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html

---

## 📄 `html/index.html`

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Docker Nginx Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from Docker Volume 🚀</h1>
    <p>This page is served from my local machine.</p>
  </body>
</html>

---

## 🔍 Line-by-line: What Changed

### `volumes:`

* This tells Docker:
  **“Sync files between my machine and the container”**

---

### `- ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html`

Format:

```
HOST_PATH : CONTAINER_PATH
```

* `./html`

  * Local folder on your system
* `/usr/share/nginx/html`

  * Default directory where Nginx serves static files

👉 Anything you put in `./html` is **instantly available** inside the container.

---

## ▶️ Run It

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now open:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You’ll see **your custom HTML**, not the default Nginx page 🎉

---

## 🔥 Try This (You’ll Feel the Power)

1. Keep Docker running
2. Edit `html/index.html`
3. Refresh the browser

No rebuild. No restart.
That’s **live mounting** 💥
