image: nginx:latest
container_name: nginx_basic
ports:
- "8080:80"

## 🔍 Line-by-line Explanation

### `version: "3.9"`

* This tells Docker **which Compose file format** you’re using
* `3.9` is stable and works with modern Docker Engine
* It does **not** mean Docker version

---

### `services:`

* This is the **heart of docker-compose**
* Every container you want to run is defined under `services`
* Think of it as:
  **“What applications do I want to run?”**

---

### `nginx:`

* This is the **service name**
* Docker uses this name internally:

  * As a DNS hostname
  * For networking between containers
* You’ll later do things like `curl http://nginx`

---

### `image: nginx:latest`

* Tells Docker to use the **official Nginx image**
* `latest` means:

  * Pull the most recent stable version from Docker Hub
* If the image doesn’t exist locally, Docker will **auto-download it**

---

### `container_name: nginx_basic`

* Explicitly names the container
* Without this, Docker auto-generates a name like:
  `project_nginx_1`
* Helps when running commands like:

  ```bash
  docker logs nginx_basic
  ```

---

### `ports:`

* Used to **expose container ports to your host machine**
* Format:

  ```
  HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT
  ```

---

### `- "8080:80"`

* `80` → Port where Nginx listens **inside the container**
* `8080` → Port exposed on **your machine**
* So when you open:

  ```
  http://localhost:8080
  ```

  you’re actually hitting:

  ```
  container:80
  ```

---

## ▶️ How to Run This

```bash
docker compose up
```

(or `docker-compose up` if you’re on older Docker)

Now open your browser:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You should see the **default Nginx welcome page** 🎉
